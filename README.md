# WhatsApp Group Chat Analysis

This project analyzes a WhatsApp group chat conversation to gain insights into the communication patterns, most active users, popular emojis, and more.

## Introduction

The analysis is performed on the WhatsApp group chat data using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and emoji_data_python. The data is preprocessed and visualized to extract meaningful information.

## Features

- **Message Count Analysis**: Analyze the total number of messages sent per day, per month, and per hour.
- **Top Users Analysis**: Identify the most active users based on the number of messages sent.
- **Emoji Analysis**: Explore the most frequently used emojis in the conversation.
- **Word Clouds**: Generate word clouds to visualize the most common words used in the chat.
- **Heatmap Analysis**: Visualize the message count by day and month using a heatmap.
