28/01/2020, 7:25 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Guys today's q.
28/01/2020, 7:25 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): All the elements of the input array will be consisting of '0' s and '1' s.
You have to output a single line 
With all the 1's and then remaining 0's of the input array.

Input format :
Take n,After that next line contains, n spaced integers i.e a1,a2...an  denoting the elements of the array.

Output format :
Print a single line consisting of length n.

Sample input:
6
0 1 0 1 0 1

Sample output:
1 1 1 0 0 0

Explaination :
As we can see there are 3 ones and 3 zeros in the input array,So output is accordingly.
28/01/2020, 7:29 pm - Samay Raina: Just a note
28/01/2020, 7:29 pm - Samay Raina: Haan will try
28/01/2020, 7:29 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): .
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Just someone run this on your pc/laptop
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): And please explain the output
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Samay Raina: Yes
 Plz
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): It has something to do with how second condition of B is placed.
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - +91 99201 75875: Assuming you're not supposed to used in built sort functions right?
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Because if you reverse it. Write k first and then i
28/01/2020, 7:31 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): You get a totally different output
28/01/2020, 7:31 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): How???
28/01/2020, 7:39 pm - Manvi Jain: Can you send the complete code? What is in the second printf?
28/01/2020, 7:41 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): https://youtu.be/AU7mADJMa9Y

28/01/2020, 7:47 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): No.Don't use any built functions.
28/01/2020, 7:47 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): In-built
28/01/2020, 7:48 pm - Manvi Jain: Because it enters the loop because of k. And i gets printed too.
28/01/2020, 7:49 pm - Manvi Jain: The condition of k becomes true and therefore it enters the loop. From 2 to 20 with a gap of 2. Therefore it enters 10 times and i gets printed instead from 1-10
28/01/2020, 7:50 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): So conclusion is
If there are multiple conditions in a single ' for loop' then even if one statement is satisfied then loop will run for that condition.
28/01/2020, 7:51 pm - Manvi Jain: Yes. It's like any one of these conditions should be true. It's like using "OR". And not "AND".
28/01/2020, 7:51 pm - Janvi Rathod: But depends na

Conditions ke middle me and hai ya or

One more thing 

We've gotta manage our academics also along with coding 

I know pointers don't matter much

But getting a decent pointer is important.....

If you all can 
You'll should allocate specific time for coding....

WAP to check whether a no. is automorphic/circular or not.

A no is said to automorphic/circular if square of the no ends with the same no 
Eg. 
*5* and 2 *5*,
*25* and 6 *25*,
*76* and 57 *76*

Do 
num==sqr%pow(10,digits);

29/01/2020, 10:24 pm - +91 89764 07509: bro ek question hai

29/01/2020, 10:28 pm - +91 89764 07509: infact mere hisaab se undeclared indentifier ka error bhi pop up hona chaiye tha but run horaha haiü§Øü§Ø
29/01/2020, 10:47 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): This is because 52 (i.e. 25) might be stored as 24.9999999 or 25.0000000001 because the return type is double. When assigned to int, 25.0000000001 becomes 25 but 24.9999999 will give output 24.
To overcome this and output the accurate answer in integer format, we can add 0.5 to the result and typecast it to int e.g (int)(pow(5, 2)+0.5) will give the correct answer(25, in above example), irrespective of the compiler.

29/01/2020, 10:56 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): for 24.9999999 when you typecast it into int then it will be roundoff to 24 but if you add 0.5 you will be safe even if it's 25.000000001

29/01/2020, 11:29 pm - +91 99201 75875: It's a replacement for return 0
Return 0 terminates the program
cin.get() waits for the user to press a key (like Enter) before terminating the program

29/01/2020, 11:36 pm - +91 99201 75875: getch is not part of the std library and is more turbo c++ specific tbh

29/01/2020, 11:43 pm - Samay Raina: darshan sir told us to avoid statements like break if possible since it causes halt in the flow of the program abruptly and causes voltage fluctuations  (just telling this to you),so just keep that in mind
29/01/2020, 11:43 pm - Samay Raina: Otherwise logic is excellent
29/01/2020, 11:44 pm - +91 99201 75875: Break is a really really common statement and is present in all programs
Sir might've said cause turbo C might not be able to handle it

29/01/2020, 11:48 pm - +91 99201 75875: Let's say this is true then you could use the same logic and instead of writing it in main(),  make a separate function which just returned a Boolean and in the if statement replace break with return false and return true if the entire loop executes 
And in main just call the function with the user input int

else in the room. Given the fact that any two persons shake hand exactly once, Can you tell the total
count of handshakes?
Input Format
The first line contains the number of test cases T, T lines follow.
Each line then contains an integer N, the total number of Board of Directors of Acme.
Output Format
Print the number of handshakes for each test-case in a new line.
Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000
0 < N < 10
Sample Input
2
1
2
Sample Output
0
1
Explanation
Case 1 : The lonely board member shakes no hands, hence 0.
Case 2 : There are 2 board members, 1 handshake takes place.

In C/C++ even after using the 'long long int' data type, we can compute factorial upto 20. 

Today's challenge is to write a program in C/C++ to calculate fatorial of a number 'N'

where 0 <= N <= 100

0! = 1
1! = 1
50! = 30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000

12/02/2020, 7:42 pm - Anjali Kapoor: This should be same our usual factorial program
12/02/2020, 7:42 pm - Ankit (TSEC, CS): nope you have to use arrays and then use it
12/02/2020, 7:42 pm - Janvi Rathod: Just to say
100!  Has 158 digits
12/02/2020, 7:43 pm - Janvi Rathod: There you are....

12/02/2020, 8:40 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): My tips:
1)First get firm with language.
2)Do some good implementation q's.
3)In case your code gets *tle* just try to optimize by removing unnecessary nested for loops.

It is an easier one. Then to that one
14/02/2020, 7:01 pm - Janvi Rathod: Today's Challenge:

You are given a *sorted* array NUM of *integers* as input.

You have to generate a *sorted* array SQ of the *squares* of the *integers* of the given array.

Constraints:

1 <= length(NUM) <= 10000
-10000 <= element of NUM <= 10000

This can be done in linear time complexity.
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Janvi Rathod: Please try to do this without nested for loops
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Means ? What shud be the output?
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Janvi Rathod: An array of squares of the numbers
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Janvi Rathod: in the given array
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Samay Raina: ^
14/02/2020, 7:04 pm - Janvi Rathod: this is out put
14/02/2020, 7:04 pm - Samay Raina: K
14/02/2020, 7:04 pm - Janvi Rathod: Ill send example
14/02/2020, 7:04 pm - Janvi Rathod: wait

14/02/2020, 7:04 pm - +91 95949 08570: Pls
14/02/2020, 7:04 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Understood bud
14/02/2020, 7:05 pm - Janvi Rathod: NUM = { -2 , -1 , 0, 3, 5}
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - Janvi Rathod: Output:

SQ = { 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 25 }
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - +91 95949 08570: Ok so first we have to find the squares
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - +91 95949 08570: Put it in another array
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - +91 95949 08570: Then sort it
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Janvi Rathod: ya
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - +91 95949 08570: Correct?

14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Janvi Rathod: but that is very very inefficient
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Janvi Rathod: can be done using  better logic
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Janvi Rathod: only 1 for loop
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Kinda ascending? Descending?
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Janvi Rathod: see example
14/02/2020, 7:08 pm - +91 95949 08570: Yes
14/02/2020, 7:08 pm - +91 96536 93868: for sorting we need nested loop but the question can be solved without it .....
14/02/2020, 7:08 pm - Janvi Rathod: exactly
14/02/2020, 7:08 pm - Rupali Jain: @919594908570 
I had implemented a similar program in Java with Strings.
I have tested it with numbers upto 1000.

    int n,max=-1000,is_zero=0;
    cin>>n;
    int a[n],c[10000]={0};

        c[abs(a[i])]++;
        if(abs(a[i])>max){
            max=abs(a[i]);
        }

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.

 

*Input:*

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.

 

*Output:*

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!

20/02/2020, 11:17 pm - Samay Raina: Explain this
20/02/2020, 11:18 pm - Mithun Kapoor: Besides binary search and quick sort everything should be working
20/02/2020, 11:18 pm - Janvi Rathod: Nice
20/02/2020, 11:18 pm - +91 77180 82108: Uhm I think it‚Äôs better if you focus on C for now and then do Python when you have your vacations
20/02/2020, 11:18 pm - Janvi Rathod: Do add visualization too
20/02/2020, 11:18 pm - Sanyog Sharma: I did
20/02/2020, 11:18 pm - +91 77180 82108: Because Python won‚Äôt take much time to learn tbh

20/02/2020, 11:19 pm - Mithun Kapoor: Yes future part
20/02/2020, 11:19 pm - Mithun Kapoor: Want to add everything firdt
20/02/2020, 11:19 pm - +91 77180 82108: And if you learn Python before C/Java (you have these as your sem subjects) then you won‚Äôt feel like learning those
20/02/2020, 11:19 pm - Janvi Rathod: cool
20/02/2020, 11:19 pm - Mithun Kapoor: True
20/02/2020, 11:19 pm - +91 77180 82108: Because Python really makes things easier

20/02/2020, 11:21 pm - +91 77180 82108: But the thing is if they learn Python at this stage then they won‚Äôt be interested in learning Java at all which might lead to them performing poorly in their practical exam which is gonna affect their pointer
20/02/2020, 11:22 pm - Samay Raina: Comps
20/02/2020, 11:22 pm - +91 77180 82108: Just my opinion

21/02/2020, 12:41 am - Anjali Kapoor: Pehle ke 2 pending haiüòÇ
21/02/2020, 12:41 am - Sanyog Sharma: Can you resend all coding challenges?
21/02/2020, 12:41 am - Manvi Jain: ^
21/02/2020, 12:41 am - Manvi Jain: Sussutu is a world-renowned magician. And recently, he was blessed with the power to remove EXACTLY ONE element from an array.

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.

 

*Input:*

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.

 

*Output:*

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!

 

*Constraints:*

1 < N < 105

0 < Ak < 109
21/02/2020, 12:42 am - Manvi Jain: Take a string as an input from the user.
Make a new string of length 18 characters, containing random characters and the new string should also contain each and every letter of the input string(also distributed randomly).
Example
Input:
Controller
Output:

My solution for this
21/02/2020, 12:43 am - Sanyog Sharma: BruteForce
21/02/2020, 12:44 am - Anjali Kapoor: Ha
21/02/2020, 12:46 am - Sanyog Sharma: It can be done in O(n) too
21/02/2020, 12:47 am - Sanyog Sharma: This fails if number of elements is large , say 10^8
21/02/2020, 12:47 am - Sanyog Sharma: Time limit exceeded aayega
21/02/2020, 12:48 am - Anjali Kapoor: Ab ye samjh ke bahar jaa raha haiüòÇ
21/02/2020, 12:49 am - Sanyog Sharma: Chill, workshop me we'll to teach this stuff
21/02/2020, 12:49 am - Samay Raina: This happens in hackerrank
21/02/2020, 12:49 am - Sanyog Sharma: Happens on every website
21/02/2020, 12:50 am - Samay Raina: Haan
21/02/2020, 1:17 am - Mudit Verma: Oh this is GOLD, but very difficult to follow.
21/02/2020, 1:22 am - Mudit Verma: We will share some resources in the workshop...
21/02/2020, 1:22 am - Mudit Verma: What all do you know, Tanay?
21/02/2020, 1:23 am - Samay Raina: üôÅa bit of HTML
21/02/2020, 1:23 am - Shreya (TSEC, IT): Lol same. Literally.
21/02/2020, 1:23 am - Mudit Verma: That's completely alright!
21/02/2020, 1:24 am - Mudit Verma: Why front end?
21/02/2020, 1:25 am - Samay Raina: Full stack developer
21/02/2020, 1:25 am - Mudit Verma: Okay
21/02/2020, 1:26 am - Mudit Verma: For now, just do HTML and CSS.
21/02/2020, 1:26 am - Samay Raina: Ohküëç
21/02/2020, 1:27 am - Mudit Verma: Don't want to overwhelm you with a lot of stuff to be done or anything else...

21/02/2020, 1:34 am - Mudit Verma: Just keep following the videos, you'll learn quite a lot!
21/02/2020, 1:35 am - Mudit Verma: Also, don't just watch the videos.

Do everything side by side and make short notes in your editor itself. They help while revising (if you've not touched the tech for a long time).
21/02/2020, 1:44 am - Manvi Jain: Even The Net Ninja has good web development courses. For beginners^

22/02/2020, 10:05 pm - Sanyog Sharma: You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower you Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.

22/02/2020, 11:01 pm - Janvi Rathod: Also, 
Many of us are  used to coding in an IDE or Text editor 
the environment of Hackerrank/Codechef/Codeforces is very different 
So a little into to that will be great
Like, most of the times, our solution is correct but because we did not print output in the way they wanted, it shows an error
22/02/2020, 11:04 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Yes that'll be covered , dw
22/02/2020, 11:17 pm - shivika malik: i find coding in text editor easier than hackerrank or other site Ide...u just upload the local file while submitting
22/02/2020, 11:18 pm - Janvi Rathod: Ya, but you gotta see how they take input and out put na
Consider testcases
make for loops and all
22/02/2020, 11:19 pm - shivika malik: so that can be done in text editors too right..?
22/02/2020, 11:20 pm - Janvi Rathod: yes
22/02/2020, 11:20 pm - Janvi Rathod: But the problem is I can't analyse how they want input some times

01/03/2020, 10:57 am - shivika malik: Instructions for the mashup:
You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

Here is the link for today's contest:

01/03/2020, 11:02 am - Sanyog Sharma: Register before contest starts or else you won't be able to enter.
01/03/2020, 11:02 am - +91 79770 56210: Where can we find the conventions which we have to follow like using int main return 0 instead of void main
01/03/2020, 11:03 am - Sanyog Sharma: use int main return 0
01/03/2020, 11:03 am - Sanyog Sharma: instead of void main
01/03/2020, 11:03 am - Sanyog Sharma: for some weird reason this doesn't work
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - +91 79770 56210: But r there any other things that we need to know like this one
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Sanyog Sharma: No, nothing else
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Sanyog Sharma: .
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - +91 79770 56210: Ok
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Sanyog Sharma: when you use void main program keeps on running?
01/03/2020, 11:05 am - +91 79770 56210: It runs in the ide but when i submit it it gives runtime error
01/03/2020, 11:08 am - Sanyog Sharma: i guess CodeForces's compiler expects a return value 0 to be returned from every program. If 0 is returned, it means program has been executed successfully. If anything other than that means something is wrong with the code.
01/03/2020, 11:09 am - +91 79770 56210: Ohk
01/03/2020, 11:09 am - +91 99693 94098: void main never worked with C89 or C99 anyway
Woh waise bhi error dega hi
01/03/2020, 11:10 am - Sanyog Sharma: Oh acha
01/03/2020, 11:18 am - Janvi Rathod: Thank you seniors for this wonderful exposure to competitive programming you all have given to us.....

03/03/2020, 10:24 pm - Manvi Jain: Time Limit exceeded in pretest 6.

03/03/2020, 10:25 pm - shivika malik: i didnt do 3rd
03/03/2020, 10:26 pm - Manvi Jain: Anyone else who got the third one?
03/03/2020, 10:30 pm - shivika malik: If a[i] % m = a[j] % m for some i < j, then answer is 0. Otherwise there are <= m numbers, so you can calculate answer in O(N^2).

...

BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

Integer.parseInt(in.readLine()); //for integer
in.readLine() //for String```
05/03/2020, 12:57 am - Anjali Kapoor: Btw if they are faster why they r not default in languages?üò∂
05/03/2020, 12:58 am - Anjali Kapoor: N why do we have slower versions
05/03/2020, 1:59 am - Rupali Jain: This message was deleted
05/03/2020, 2:00 am - Rupali Jain: Because they have several disadvantages as well.
For example, in C++,
```cin.tie(NULL)``` means that you can input data while the program is printing to the screen.
```ios::sync_with_stdio(false)``` does not sync ```cout``` with ```printf```.

08/03/2020, 1:59 pm - Sanyog Sharma: You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

15/03/2020, 11:58 am - Samay Raina: Example 2: This shows the creation and import of user-defined file.

Creating a user-defined header by the name of ‚Äúprocess.h‚Äù.
// It is not recommended to put function definitions 
// in a header file. Ideally there should be only 
// function declarations. Purpose of this code is 
// to only demonstrate working of header files. 

  

void add(int a, int b) 
{ 

    printf("Added value=%d\n", a + b); 
} 

  

void multiply(int a, int b) 
{ 

    printf("Multiplied value=%d\n", a * b); 
} 
Created the main file where the above ‚Äúprocess.h‚Äù will be included.
// C program to illustrate file inclusion 
// <> used to import system header file 
#include <stdio.h> 

  
// " " used to import user-defined file 
#include "process.h" 

  
// main function 

int main() 
{ 

    // add function defined in process.h 

    add(10, 20); 

  

    // mult function defined in process.h 

    mult(10, 20); 

  

    // printf defined in stdio.h 

    printf("Process completed");

1. hackerRank
2. HackerEarth
3. Codechef
4. Codeforces

Please start practicing on hackerRank and HackerEarth first
Get comfortable with it and then on codechef and codeforces

Otherwise problems on codechef and codeforces are enough to make u feel demotivated .
Although there certain programmers specially like Abdullah Aslam 7 Star coder on codechef who directly started with codechef but i don't recommend that follow a straight and simple way and progress gradually.
17/03/2020, 1:16 pm - +91 73043 57388: Ok everyone so let's start
Road to CP
1. First thing u have to do is to make a firm and strong decision whether u really wanna do CP or not.
Reason why I am telling u this is because many people just do it because their classmates are doing CP and they appear to be alien in that field which is not the correct reason to do something.
Let me tell u one thing very honestly if u want job in product based companies of Software development engineer position u need to have good problem solving skills at any cost whatsoever and excellent knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms.
If u are doing CP like I opened my laptop today and I am opening it after 20 days it's not gonna work like that way if ur serious about CP then u have to chalk a good week plan be consistent and steadfast in it.
Sometimes it may happen that u become demotivated and left CP for a month or so BUT it should happen only sometimes and u should try to come back as soon as possible
2. How to start , learn only C++ and do CP only in C++. C++ is the best language for CP.
3. For those who don't want to go for any course(which I don't recommend)

"How to manage projects development and CP?"
Check out Rachit jain answer
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: One Important thing u have to insure that will doing CP ur growth and problem solving should increase exponentially.
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: Please make sure u watch this video only after u have started with C++ and covered a large topics on it 
Otherwise trees linked list all this things might become confusing for u.

But if ur in Second year ofcourse DSA has been covered in college so u should try to get comfortable with c++ within 2-3 weeks if u dont know c++ and then u can follow that with DSA
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: For FE students:
In college C language is covered by now,right? So learning c++ will be very easy BUT before properly learning c++ fundementals such as loops,arrays, strings, recursion, dynamic memory allocation etc and practicing questions on these topics 
Don't dare to jump on DSA.
For Second year:
Ur now stepping in third after a few months so u should better take a placement course because if u delay now things will become overwhelming because u have to Also focus on projects and when it comes to placement along with problem solving skills they will check ur knowledge of Object oriented programming, Database management, Operating System, computer networks. Many people will tell u that u don't need to take any placement course right now there is much time for campus placement but according to my experience it's better if u take a course and start preparing right away from placement point of u because till next year u can become not only a good programmer but also u will be prepared thoroughly for Campus interviews.
What u need to know about placements is that cracking interviews and CP are different things in interviews they don't expect or even bother whether ur a super competitive programmer or a 1 star programmer(although mentioning hackerRank Ranks, codechef ratings will ofcourse give golden layer to ur resume) But what they expect from u is u should be able to solve the interview problems with optimised solutions and try to think even if ur not able to solve the problem.

Companies do see ur Website profile specially hackerRank while if u Solve practice contest questions on codechef ur rating is not gonna increase as far as I know ratings codechef increases only when we participate and solve in long challenge, lunchtime and cookoff.
Rest as u wish practicing is important anyway

18/03/2020, 3:00 am - Samay Raina: Java

18/03/2020, 11:27 am - Mudit Verma: This is an implicit call for the constructor.
You never explicitly call the constructor.
When you create a new obj of a class, you invoke the constructor of that class implicitly.
18/03/2020, 11:29 am - Mudit Verma: Okay you can call another constructor explicitly from a constructor, but not otherwise.
18/03/2020, 11:30 am - Mudit Verma: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 11:30 am - Mudit Verma: This is instantiation of an object
18/03/2020, 11:31 am - Mudit Verma: So no, instantiation of an obj is not an explicit call to the constructor...

18/03/2020, 12:32 pm - Rupali Jain: OK, yes, this is instantiation of an object, but how is this an implicit call?

You, the programmer, is explicitly writing ```new Object()```.

If this is an implicit call, then can you please give an example of an explicit call.
18/03/2020, 12:36 pm - Rupali Jain: Did you read the article?

I think that it is about constructor overloading using ```this```.
18/03/2020, 7:01 pm - Rupali Jain: https://youtu.be/0CDKwzf0JxM
18/03/2020, 7:09 pm - +91 97739 65140: Ok so this is how I have learnt it.
In Java if you write Obj object, it implicitly and in your class if there is no constructor,then javac automatically puts a non-paratmeterized constructor in your class
Hence, implicit call
*But* ,if you define a constructor in your class ,it is you who explicitly define it and hence that constructor will be used by javac in your program for object instantiation.
18/03/2020, 7:10 pm - +91 97739 65140: The second case will be explicit creation
18/03/2020, 7:10 pm - +91 97739 65140: *call
18/03/2020, 7:26 pm - Rupali Jain: You are mixing the default (implicit) constructor *definition* with implicit *calling*.
18/03/2020, 7:26 pm - Samay Raina: Yeah
18/03/2020, 7:28 pm - Rupali Jain: When you define a class and do not provide a constructor, Java implicitly defines the default constructor.

But when you declare an object as ```Object obj```, *no constructor is called* and ```obj = null```.
18/03/2020, 7:28 pm - Rupali Jain: This is unlike C++, where the non parameterized constructor is called implicitly.

21/03/2020, 1:18 pm - Sanyog Sharma: You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.
Good luck!

Internet services have become slow & there can be a complete breakdown, so lets not fwd VIDEOS ...

There is limited bandwidth only. It‚Äôs being heavily guzzled by OTTs steaming videos- Amazon/ hot star / Netflix. 

Critical services  need to be prioritised.

 Internet providers are having a tough time keeping the telco facilities on with all sorts of lock down and mass apathy and no staff. 

So please only use and watch what‚Äôs necessary and switch to non HD streaming

 üôè. And don‚Äôt forward non essential videos.

Else full shut down is not far. If they shut down
Pls be careful

26/03/2020, 12:06 pm - Samay Raina: In today's world, basic programming skills are extremely advantageous in a tech driven world. You can use it to customise games, build your own websites and do things that you can't already do with your computer. As a computer engineering student I have done this before for first year engineering students and 8th grade students. During this time of curfew, I feel I should introduce even more people to this amazing skill.

The workshop shall be conducted online, as either a call or youtube live.

The workshop shall be completely free of charge.

30/03/2020, 8:19 pm - Samay Raina: i had found this soln online it was good
30/03/2020, 8:20 pm - Sanyog Sharma: This makes it much easier
30/03/2020, 8:58 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Ig upper_bound will make it much simpler
30/03/2020, 9:11 pm - Sanyog Sharma: No, upper bound returns an iterator to the value just greater than X. 

Lower bound returns an iterator to the value NOT LESS THAN 'X'. Means lower bound will return an iterator to the value if value is present the array . While upper bound will return an iterator to the element which is strictly greater than the value. If value is not present in the array it will return an iterator pointing to position just after vector_name.end().While lower bound will return an iterator pointing to the value.
30/03/2020, 9:14 pm - +91 88305 26885: Then in this we might have to implement binary search
30/03/2020, 9:14 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Lower bound internally binary search hi hai
30/03/2020, 9:14 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): #include <bits/stdc++.h>

30/03/2020, 9:14 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): here is my soln
30/03/2020, 9:15 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): yes same condition required
30/03/2020, 9:15 pm - +91 88305 26885: Like the whole code and modify a bit
30/03/2020, 9:16 pm - Sanyog Sharma: To use lower bound , array should be sorted in increasing order
30/03/2020, 9:16 pm - Sanyog Sharma: For upper bound too

31/03/2020, 12:06 pm - shivika malik: I embarked on my journey of learning and discovering  ML in the first year of Engineering, ever since each day is about figuring out fascinating developments in ML üìä
However this journey would not be easy if it weren't for the support of my seniors,mentors and the exposures I got being a part of committees in college.
Few days ago when people approached me for organizing an *ML workshop*, I thought there was no better way to reciprocate the support and push I had received myself when I started some years back.
So I will be organising a workshop on ML:

*Where:* Online

*Time:* next week, time suitable to all

*Cost*: üÜì

Lets make the most of the time, that we have in abundance due to lockdown, to discover and gain a basic idea as to what ML is!
*Those interested please fill out the form:*  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRAs17JL2S7Ynm5LdHXLEmkzZ2mIONcXPgGSaKdwKJNDXjBA/viewform?usp=sf_link

31/03/2020, 3:36 pm - Manvi Jain: This ML Workshop would be directed in a way to introduce all interested to the world of ML (it is kinda impossible to teach everything in a workshop, but its a good idea to get started on it.)
31/03/2020, 3:37 pm - Manvi Jain: The workshop would consist of the following topics:
Numpy and Pandas
Data Preprocessing(using Numpy and Pandas)
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Deep Learning and Transfer Learning
31/03/2020, 3:39 pm - Manvi Jain: The above three are branches of ML. A proper introduction would be given, along with one or two models in it for understanding. Though there will be a prerequisite of python, but he'll be going through the basics at the start.
He will try to explain a few projects, share the code for us to understand.

03/04/2020, 10:06 pm - +91 88305 26885: Iterate over the array and check whether we have a permutation upto this index
03/04/2020, 10:06 pm - shivika malik: ohhh okay
03/04/2020, 10:07 pm - +91 88305 26885: U had any other thoughts?
03/04/2020, 10:08 pm - shivika malik: i was thinking about iterative only between pos of 1s
03/04/2020, 10:09 pm - shivika malik: didnt consider the fact that 0 answer was possible too
03/04/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 88305 26885: What was ur approach for checking permutation?
03/04/2020, 10:10 pm - shivika malik: what was ur tc?
03/04/2020, 10:10 pm - shivika malik: used set
03/04/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 88305 26885: Oh and then check is size equal to max element and all
03/04/2020, 10:11 pm - shivika malik: hmm wouldnt work for l2 though
03/04/2020, 10:12 pm - +91 88305 26885: My code took 342ms others had 42ms also
03/04/2020, 10:13 pm - shivika malik: ohhh
03/04/2020, 10:13 pm - shivika malik: how did u check permutation?
03/04/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 88305 26885: Inserted in the set maintained two variables for min and Max and then checked whether size is equal to max or not and  min =1
03/04/2020, 10:15 pm - shivika malik: nice i had thought about it but didnt think that would've been efficient xP
03/04/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 88305 26885: Hmm

ArrayList<String> fruits=new ArrayList ();
List<String> fruits = new ArrayList();
04/04/2020, 9:59 pm - Samay Raina: Also can any1 explain the meaning of the second statement in this?
04/04/2020, 9:59 pm - Samay Raina: This message was deleted
04/04/2020, 10:33 pm - Rupali Jain: Technically, both your statements are wrong:
```ArrayList<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
List<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();```

04/04/2020, 10:35 pm - Rupali Jain: In 1st statement, variable ```fruits``` is an ArrayList, and in second statement, it is of type List.
List is an abstract class, so it cannot be instantiated directly.
List is used to group several different implementations of Lists, like ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.
04/04/2020, 10:37 pm - Rupali Jain: Both statements have almost identical functionality, the only difference is that if you want to change the implementation for any reason, you will have to update all the code.
The second statement allows you to hide the actual list implementation.
05/04/2020, 12:13 am - Samay Raina: Ty
05/04/2020, 12:13 am - Samay Raina: It gives a warning
05/04/2020, 12:14 am - Samay Raina: List is an interface iy
05/04/2020, 12:14 am - Samay Raina: Ig
05/04/2020, 12:17 am - Rupali Jain: No: ```error: List is abstract; cannot be instantiated```.
05/04/2020, 12:17 am - Rupali Jain: I mean both are not type safe.
05/04/2020, 12:17 am - Samay Raina: Yeah
05/04/2020, 12:18 am - Samay Raina: Gives issues
05/04/2020, 12:19 am - Samay Raina: Collection is an interface and List extends Collection and itself is an interface as well
05/04/2020, 12:19 am - Samay Raina: Then ArrayList,LinkedList etc are classes in List
05/04/2020, 12:23 am - Rupali Jain: You learn something every day.
05/04/2020, 12:23 am - Rupali Jain: ```public interface List<E> extends Collection<E>```
05/04/2020, 12:24 am - Rupali Jain: (From the source code)
05/04/2020, 12:24 am - Rupali Jain: But did you understand the difference?
05/04/2020, 12:27 am - Manvi Jain: üôåüèª
05/04/2020, 12:27 am - Samay Raina: I am learning Java from Apni kaksha(Aman Dhattarwal's channel)
05/04/2020, 12:28 am - Samay Raina: ü§î why is there a generic at the end
05/04/2020, 12:28 am - Rupali Jain: Because Collection is also generic.

05/04/2020, 5:17 pm - Vikram Nandal: Given a string of digits S, insert a minimum number of opening and closing parentheses into it such that the resulting string is balanced and each digit d is inside exactly d pairs of matching parentheses.
Let the nesting of two parentheses within a string be the substring that occurs strictly between them. An opening parenthesis and a closing parenthesis that is further to its right are said to match if their nesting is empty, or if every parenthesis in their nesting matches with another parenthesis in their nesting. The nesting depth of a position p is the number of pairs of matching parentheses m such that p is included in the nesting of m.
For example, in the following strings, all digits match their nesting depth: 0((2)1), (((3))1(2)), ((((4)))), ((2))((2))(1). The first three strings have minimum length among those that have the same digits in the same order, but the last one does not since ((22)1) also has the digits 221 and is shorter.
Given a string of digits S, find another string S', comprised of parentheses and digits, such that:
all parentheses in S' match some other parenthesis,
removing any and all parentheses from S' results in S,
each digit in S' is equal to its nesting depth, and
S' is of minimum length.
Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each line represents a test case and contains only the string S.
Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the string S' defined above.
Limits
Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.
Memory limit: 1GB.
1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 100.
1 ‚â§ length of S ‚â§ 100.
Test set 1 (Visible Verdict)
Each character in S is either 0 or 1.
Test set 2 (Visible Verdict)
Each character in S is a decimal digit between 0 and 9, inclusive.
Sample

Input   
 
4
0000
101
111000
1

Output 
Case #1: 0000
Case #2: (1)0(1)
Case #3: (111)000
Case #4: (1)

  
The strings ()0000(), (1)0(((()))1) and (1)(11)000 are not valid solutions to Sample Cases #1, #2 and #3, respectively, only because they are not of minimum length. In addition, 1)( and )(1 are not valid solutions to Sample Case #4 because they contain unmatched parentheses and the nesting depth is 0 at the position where there is a 1.
You can create sample inputs that are valid only for Test Set 2 by removing the parentheses from the example strings mentioned in the problem statement.
05/04/2020, 5:18 pm - Vikram Nandal: Anyone got solution to this?
05/04/2020, 5:19 pm - +91 82916 21138: Use stack
05/04/2020, 5:20 pm - Rishab Saini (TSEC CS, TE): No need to use that too
Just a counter and an empty string's enough
05/04/2020, 5:21 pm - shivika malik: U solved it using stack?
05/04/2020, 5:21 pm - Vikram Nandal: In python converting it to str to list and since lists are like vectors i manuplate it and then at last convert it to str back
05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - Vikram Nandal: Is what I thought
05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - Vikram Nandal: Nope
05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 82916 21138: I did not give today's mashup but I saw similar kind of stuff
05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - shivika malik: Oh okay
05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 82916 21138: But without it it can be done
05/04/2020, 5:23 pm - +91 82916 21138: Its good problem but I saw something similar but was bit more high level so they used stack  I got confused and thought it's same problem ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇüòÖ
05/04/2020, 5:24 pm - shivika malik: Could be solved by just traversing string..
05/04/2020, 5:25 pm - Vikram Nandal: Oh u mean slicing
05/04/2020, 5:26 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya thought of it but how would nesting of brackets work is where I got confused let me try that way
05/04/2020, 5:30 pm - +91 82916 21138: Stack will do the work ü§î
05/04/2020, 6:31 pm - Rupali Jain: I solved using array.

```import java.util.*;
import java.math.*;

//public class Solution{
public class A{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		char[] a;
		StringBuffer o;
		for(int t = 0, cases = sc.nextInt(); t < cases; t++){
			a = sc.next().toCharArray();
			
			o = new StringBuffer();
			repeat('(', a[0] - '0', o);
			o.append(a[0]);
			for(int i = 1, d; i < a.length; i++){
				d = a[i] - a[i - 1];
				if(d < 0)
					repeat(')', -d, o);
				else if(d > 0)
					repeat('(', d, o);
				
				o.append(a[i]);
			}
			repeat(')', a[a.length - 1] - '0', o);
			
			System.out.println("Case #" + (t + 1) + ": " + o);
		}
		
		sc.close();
	}
	
	private static void repeat(char c, int n, StringBuffer sb){
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			sb.append(c);
	}
}```
05/04/2020, 6:32 pm - Vikram Nandal: Yes slicing joining i.e string manipulation I could make it work
05/04/2020, 6:33 pm - Vikram Nandal: This will work thanks
05/04/2020, 7:35 pm - Vikram Nandal: T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    S = str(input())
    y = ''.join([int(strelement) * '(' + strelement + ')' * int(strelement) for strelement in S])
    for j in range(9):
        y = y.replace(')(', '')
    print("Case #{}: {}".format(i+1, y))
05/04/2020, 7:36 pm - Vikram Nandal: Searching Number In String Then Based on its value adding numbersValue * that many brackets and replacing )( brackets caused due to numbers of same order

07/04/2020, 1:13 am - Samay Raina: can any1 explain why are using (String) in the above code?
07/04/2020, 1:58 am - +91 77150 51136: (String) is not requiredüòÖ
07/04/2020, 1:58 am - Samay Raina: Yeah figured it out
07/04/2020, 1:59 am - Samay Raina: But when is it required then
07/04/2020, 1:59 am - Samay Raina: I mean its a non-primitive data type right?
07/04/2020, 2:11 am - Rupali Jain: (String) al.get(0); is explicit typecasting.
It is only required when your code is not typesafe.

If you make a generic (Object) ArrayList as: ```List al = new ArrayList();```, then you will need to typecast the objects while using get.
07/04/2020, 2:12 am - Rupali Jain: That is the reason why it is always encouraged to have a datatype in the ArrayList.
07/04/2020, 2:15 am - Rupali Jain: Side note: If you have a generic ArrayList, then code like this will work.
```List al = new ArrayList();
al.add("Abcd");
al.add(10);
al.add(true);```

11/04/2020, 8:24 pm - +91 97027 35002: Python

11/04/2020, 8:27 pm - Vikram Nandal: It is a iterator in python used to return values of a specific data type in a list, tuple, string or dictionaries
11/04/2020, 8:32 pm - Manvi Jain: Map function is used to execute a function (defined) or also with the lambda expression and the values to be executed are also passed through.
11/04/2020, 8:32 pm - Manvi Jain: ```map(func, *iterables)```
11/04/2020, 8:33 pm - +91 97027 35002: Got it
11/04/2020, 8:38 pm - Vikram Nandal: Can someone help me with a example and explaination of the usage of abstract classes and interfaces in Java
11/04/2020, 8:39 pm - Sanyog Sharma: @917506412914 @918080142783
11/04/2020, 8:42 pm - Mudit Verma: If you work in an organisation and you need to follow a certain structure, an interface can be used to have uniformity of structure, but difference of implementations.

Interfaces help to maintain uniformity and consistency.
11/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 73043 57388: Interfaces are used when objects have common properties

For example
Students common properties are
Nane roll no DOB
Etc 
So student class can be parent class
And student can be of engineering , medical, pharmacy etc
So these branches becomes child classes
11/04/2020, 8:48 pm - Mudit Verma: Abstract classes can be used when you want to enforce only certain functions in that class and leave a choice for the other functions to be used or not.

The function signatures without the ```abstract``` keyword in the abstract class do not need to be implemented compulsorily in the class extending the abstract class, but they need to.have an implementation in the abstract class. Their implementation cannot be changed or defined in the class extending the abstract class like the abstract fns
11/04/2020, 8:52 pm - +91 73043 57388: Oh sorry this is Inheritance explanation ü§¶
11/04/2020, 8:53 pm - Mudit Verma: Yeah
11/04/2020, 9:01 pm - Rupali Jain: Usually, interfaces are used to provide INDEPENDENT functionality. Like the ```Iterator``` interface allows objects to be iterated over, and the ```Runnable``` interface allows processes to run in a separate thread. You can have a class that is both iterable, and can run in a separate thread.
Interfaces are for things that applicable to a broad range of objects different objects.

Classes provide MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE functionality. Like, if you have a ```Stack`` class and a ```Queue``` class. There is no point in creating a ``StackQueue``` class.
11/04/2020, 9:04 pm - Mudit Verma: Yeah makes sense
Thank you
11/04/2020, 9:04 pm - Vikram Nandal: So a superclass can inherit multiple such interfaces whereas it can only inherit one abstract class right?
11/04/2020, 9:07 pm - Mudit Verma: Yes
11/04/2020, 9:07 pm - Rupali Jain: The PARENT class is called superclass.
Child classes are called subclasses.

In Java, one (sub)class can only inherit from one superclass, and multiple interfaces.

Note: C++ allows multiple inheritance.
11/04/2020, 9:08 pm - Mudit Verma: A child class*

12/04/2020, 5:31 pm - Samay Raina: Codeforces mai it is ig,thats why run time error aa rha hai
12/04/2020, 5:31 pm - +91 82916 21138: I used doubly ended queue
12/04/2020, 5:31 pm - shivika malik: After finding SCC we get condensed graph and now in this condensed graph we can count nodes with indeg 0

for char in string.ascii_lowercase:

12/04/2020, 6:41 pm - Manvi Jain: suggestion: string.ascii_lowercase can be directly used for lower case alphabets.
12/04/2020, 6:41 pm - Vikram Nandal: why is this faster ?

12/04/2020, 6:44 pm - Vikram Nandal: any idea why urs works faster?
12/04/2020, 6:45 pm - Vikram Nandal: are while loops slower than for loops?
12/04/2020, 6:45 pm - Vikram Nandal: or is slicing the problem?
12/04/2020, 6:45 pm - Vikram Nandal: if anyone knows pls tell
12/04/2020, 6:47 pm - Manvi Jain: I think nested loops increases time a lot more in python. Initially, I used while and for; which gave me TLE.
12/04/2020, 6:48 pm - Manvi Jain: Therefore, alternative would be by taking that counter ```k```, avoiding the while loop.
12/04/2020, 6:48 pm - Manvi Jain: I don't think so^

12/04/2020, 7:17 pm - +91 77150 51136: Maybe you can use replace
12/04/2020, 7:43 pm - Vikram Nandal: replace will remove all occurences of given character from string so i think will not work
12/04/2020, 7:47 pm - +91 77150 51136: It also has count parameter
12/04/2020, 7:47 pm - +91 77150 51136: You can use that
12/04/2020, 7:48 pm - Vikram Nandal: ya wait let me try if it accepts that

12/04/2020, 8:10 pm - Vikram Nandal: There are three things increasing time complexity i think upon trying to run various versions in time it :
12/04/2020, 8:12 pm - Vikram Nandal: 1) s.count(char) != 0: instead just in operator works for checking
2) using lists therefore inturn using ranges for them as @919820487592 said they are more efficient and also thus while loop causing more time

15/04/2020, 12:43 pm - +91 73043 57388: Hello everyone there is one important thing which I learned just now that one of the person whom I reffered to follow on Quora for CP has caught for cheating in codeJam Round 1A and that is Karan Gujar 
Because I didn't knew about previous allegations on him and even now it's not 100% sure whether or not he has done it( but it seems most probably that he really cheated that's because he has deleted all his social media handles) so I suggested him.
It's very unfortunate thing that has happened and I my advice my fellow programming aspirants don't rush behind ratings, stars red coder etc focus on becoming a good programmer each day and try to learn new things all this ratings stars etc will come with time but u should not be ready to compromise ur ethics and values just for the sake of Show off and publicity because its not going to help in the long run.

18/04/2020, 10:19 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Its a Div 2 A problem
18/04/2020, 10:19 pm - Sanyog Sharma: No need of recursion
18/04/2020, 10:21 pm - Sanyog Sharma: If there is an even element in array there is an answer consisting of only it. Otherwise if there is at least two odd elements in array there is an answer consisting of this two elements. Otherwise array is only one odd element and there is no answer.

18/04/2020, 11:12 pm - +91 73043 57388: The problems on finding subsets are usually called combination of numbers problem 
For finding subsets u simply combine the concept of iteration and recursion 

For that u have to create 2 arrays one will be having all given numbers
Second array will be temporary array which is going to hold every possible subset by taking each number of the given array one by one

So suppose u have 
Given array 1 2 3 4
And u wan to find all possible subsets

We use a for loop for traversing through the given loop

For(i=0;i<n;i++)
{ 
   temp[0]=arr[i];
   Recursion_func
}

We draw a recursion tree for that
18/04/2020, 11:13 pm - +91 73043 57388: Explaination of recursion function I will give u tomorrow if u don't mind

25/04/2020, 12:10 am - Rupali Jain: Difficult choice between Python and Kotlin.
25/04/2020, 12:24 am - Samay Raina: Why tho?
25/04/2020, 12:25 am - Samay Raina: Python gone means a lot of stuff from this field gone and Kotlin gone means bye-bye android applications
25/04/2020, 12:48 am - Rupali Jain: No, just the LANGUAGE, not the all the programs. I just don't like Python's syntax.
98% of android apps are written in Java even today. Kotlin was supposed to reduce the boilerplate needed for Java.
But, in Kotlin, you have to type ```val a: int;```. In Java, it is ```int a;``` now which one is shorter?
25/04/2020, 12:49 am - Samay Raina: Kotlin is now official Android language ig
25/04/2020, 1:09 am - Rupali Jain: Yes, unfortunately. But most of the Android api's are still in Java, and even today, you cannot make an Android app without using at least some Java.
25/04/2020, 1:09 am - Rupali Jain: But both languages are JVM compatible, so I will stick to Java, at least for now.
25/04/2020, 1:13 am - Samay Raina: üëç

30/04/2020, 5:32 pm - +91 99693 94098: Hey everyone,
I would like to share with you something that I have been working with for almost 2 months now. In search for efficient medical imaging and diagnosis methods for COVID-19, I worked with radiologists at arterys.com to come up with AI based solutions for faster diagnostic methods. The challenge was to recognise early symptoms of the virus on PA Chest X-rays (since CT scans aren't always available) taken from varying hospitals across the US, China and Italy.
After extensive research with pretrained and custom models, an ensembled version of both worked well for my case of Opacity detection. This will act as a first stage diagnosis for upcoming pneumonia-like symptoms in patients. The patient will be then advised to get a PCR test done for final confirmation, thereby saving testing kits and securing lives of radiologists who might come in contact with the virus
Today I am sharing my repository with all of you to help spread the message about it. I would also like to mention that these results might lead to a few extra false positives due to the reduced threshold but active work is being put in to reduce these errors. The repo consists of a sample keras implementation of the best custom and Resnet models. Also note that training these keras models in the notebook might give different results than the included models because of the custom training loops and pruning methods applied during the original training.

02/05/2020, 4:44 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Awesome!!
02/05/2020, 4:50 pm - Mudit Verma: Good work!

My suggestions:
- Tell the user that a left swipe on a note will delete it (add a small line of text at the head)
- On the profile page at the bottom, add your name in the fol. format: 'Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Gaurav Raj' (with Gaurav Raj being a hyperlink to your social media. Your project is open source, so add a link to your repo for contributions...)
- Further features: 
-- Notifications / reminders (take both time & date)
-- Add a choice to input some description as well.

Just my opinions and suggestions, you're free to do as you want to!

Awesome work on the app. Keep building and preferably keep building up on one or two project(s) rather than making too many projects.

Keep going!

I am not really good at Development but
 --> Some small suggestions from my side.
- When we re-edit the note, try changing the date and time, as "last edited". 
- When we tap on the picture to change the profile, it opens up the camera directly. Maybe try adding another option, asking access for the gallery, so as to select the image from the gallery. 

Looks amazing! Keep it up! ^_^

03/05/2020, 7:59 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Codeforces Round #639: the round is rescheduled.

Hello, Codeforces!

Unfortunately, I report that I decided to reschedule this round. I'm afraid that something might go wrong. Some strange database behavior has appeared, which leads to slow operation in completely unexpected places (it never was and should not be). I will work hard to fix it. My recent tests show that this can dramatically increase judging time (and leads to a huge queue). I don't want to risk the efforts of the writer, the coordinator, testers, and your time. Sorry about it, I was trying to fix it for many hours but I need more time. Hope it will be a great round!

Mike.

UPD: I temporarily rescheduled it on May, 6. But I'll discuss the date with the writer and coordinator and reschedule it again to the date they want.

03/05/2020, 9:16 pm - Manvi Jain: *Sort 10 billion numbers*

10 billion numbers are given, sort them


*Approach 1 :-  (External Sorting)*
Here k is the size of maximum elements which  can be sorted internally.
Since the size of numbers is huge, we can't make use of the primary memory to serve the purpose.
1) Divide the numbers in group of k.
2) Sort each group independently in O(klogk). ( using internal sort - Quick Sort )
    Merge sort all the groups.
3) Create a min heap of size=10 billion/k.
4) Update the min heap with the minimum from each group.
5) Extract the minimum from the heap and write to a file.
6) Get the next number from the group from which extracted number belonged.
7) Update the min heap.
8) Go to step 5.



*Approach 2:- Using Doubly Ended Priority Queue (DEPQ)*

1) Read in as many elements as will fit into DEPQ.
   The elements in DEPQ will eventually be the middle group of elements.
2) Proces the remaining elements one at a time.
   If the next element <= smallest element in the DEPQ, output this element as a part of the left group.
   Else if the next element is greater  than the largest element in DEPQ, output it as a part of right group.
3) Otherwise, remove  either the min or max element from the DEPQ.
4) Output the elements in DEPQ in sorted order.
5) Sort the left and right groups recursively.

_In approach 2, we are simulating the quick sort, In quick sort , the array is broken into  L,M,R._
_where M is just a single pivot element. But in approach 2 , the whole DEPQ is acting as a pivot._

05/05/2020, 1:19 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): How 0?
05/05/2020, 1:20 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Pehle it'll assign i as 0
05/05/2020, 1:20 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Then it'll increment
05/05/2020, 1:20 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Toh i stays 0 always
05/05/2020, 1:21 pm - Sanyog Sharma: i=i++
05/05/2020, 1:21 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Iske baad I ki value badegi nhi kya?
05/05/2020, 1:22 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Badhega but that'll be useless
05/05/2020, 1:23 pm - Manvi Jain: You're basically assigning i = 0. And then incrementing the value to 1. But i is already assigned as 0. This process keeps getting repeated.
05/05/2020, 1:24 pm - Sanyog Sharma: ‚úÖ‚úÖ
05/05/2020, 1:24 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Yeah.. got it..thnx yeah..
05/05/2020, 1:24 pm - Manvi Jain: It's due to the post increment. If it was pre-increment: i = ++i, then it will increment to 1, then assign it to i. So in this case i remains 1.
05/05/2020, 1:25 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Oh ..got it
05/05/2020, 1:26 pm - +91 88305 26885: It's actually undefined
05/05/2020, 1:26 pm - +91 88305 26885: Read this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior
05/05/2020, 1:31 pm - Manvi Jain: Ohh.

05/05/2020, 1:34 pm - Manvi Jain: This seems valid.

05/05/2020, 1:37 pm - +91 88305 26885: Idk I read somewhere that the compiler may output any value

05/05/2020, 1:43 pm - Manvi Jain: This is explaination does seem valid though.
05/05/2020, 1:43 pm - +91 88305 26885: Yup
05/05/2020, 1:43 pm - +91 88305 26885: But it's more compiler based rather than a well defined error
05/05/2020, 1:44 pm - +91 97027 35002: It should get incremented after assigning value right?
05/05/2020, 1:48 pm - +91 97027 35002: Nvm got it
05/05/2020, 3:38 pm - Samay Raina: Yeah
05/05/2020, 4:31 pm - Rupali Jain: Note that this is well defined in Java, and answer is 0.

08/05/2020, 1:36 pm - Samay Raina: 1) All pending semester exams (except final semester) are effectively cancelled in Maharashtra.
2) Marks will be given according to UGC guidelines i.e. 50% marks based on this SEM internal assessment and 50% based on last semester exam performance.
3) If you are unhappy with this Sem marks, University will announce dates for Re-Exam which will probably be a 80 mark paper (not clarified as to of how many marks the re exam will be)
4) All those who fail in this Sem internal assessment will have to give exams in next sem or the Re-Exam as notified by the University.
5) All those already having ATKT in previous Sems will have to give exams for them within 120 days of college reopening, the timetable for which will be announced by respective university.

11/05/2020, 5:12 pm - Samay Raina: Guys lmk your opinion on this:
Should I do both android dev and Problem Solving together?
11/05/2020, 5:13 pm - Samay Raina: See my problem solving is again lagging since I am doing android dev recently
11/05/2020, 5:13 pm - Samay Raina: And if I start problem solving again then... android bhul jata hai
11/05/2020, 5:13 pm - Samay Raina: The thing is that....I want to improve my problem solving day by day as well as keep adding projects to GitHub.... please do help me out here....
11/05/2020, 5:14 pm - Samay Raina: Chip your opinions in plz....will be greatly appreciated
11/05/2020, 5:15 pm - shivika malik: yes
11/05/2020, 7:20 pm - Mudit Verma: Yes
11/05/2020, 7:22 pm - Mudit Verma: Don't 'keep adding projects to GitHub'. Neither is that the aim, nor is having a lot of projects the aim. The aim is to keep building up on a few projects.

11/05/2020, 8:26 pm - Rupali Jain: Why is the exe 23 MB?
11/05/2020, 8:27 pm - Mithun Kapoor: idk i converted a .py to .exe using pyinstaller,
now about the size u can ask them
11/05/2020, 8:27 pm - Mithun Kapoor: rest assured its safe
11/05/2020, 8:28 pm - Rupali Jain: OK, I thought that this was a native program. If you converted a .py file then it bundles the python interpreter as well.
11/05/2020, 8:28 pm - Mithun Kapoor: try it
11/05/2020, 8:29 pm - Rupali Jain: Yes, I am downloading the file.
11/05/2020, 8:29 pm - Rupali Jain: But please just send the source files next time.

11/05/2020, 8:32 pm - Rupali Jain: Most people here have python installed.
Python comes with pip.
I also happen to have pygame installed.
The python source files will be << 1kb.
11/05/2020, 8:32 pm - Mithun Kapoor: very true
11/05/2020, 8:32 pm - Mithun Kapoor: but what about ppl who dont have it

11/05/2020, 8:36 pm - Mithun Kapoor: for the exe yes
11/05/2020, 8:36 pm - Mithun Kapoor: check the source files
11/05/2020, 8:36 pm - Mithun Kapoor: ive even included the option of setting your own board
11/05/2020, 8:36 pm - Rupali Jain: Also, you should not immediately inform the user if the entered number is wrong.
11/05/2020, 8:37 pm - Rupali Jain: Look into generating a random board each time.
11/05/2020, 8:37 pm - Mithun Kapoor: good idea
11/05/2020, 8:38 pm - Anjali Kapoor: This will make it very easy
11/05/2020, 8:38 pm - Mithun Kapoor: thats how all the sudoku websites work 
not the offline paper one
11/05/2020, 8:38 pm - Mithun Kapoor: 3 wrong then die?

11/05/2020, 8:39 pm - Mithun Kapoor: why do you love java so much
11/05/2020, 8:40 pm - Rupali Jain: It was for my final project in 10th.
11/05/2020, 8:41 pm - Rupali Jain: And I like static, strongly typed languages. That included Java and C++.
12/05/2020, 4:55 am - Mudit Verma: How did you do this?
12/05/2020, 4:57 am - Rupali Jain: Do what?

20/05/2020, 7:24 pm - Rupali Jain: I prefer GitLab.
20/05/2020, 7:24 pm - Rupali Jain: They have integrated CI/CD.
20/05/2020, 7:25 pm - +91 99201 75875: Even GitHub has CI/CD 
GitHub Actions
20/05/2020, 7:25 pm - Rupali Jain: Yes, but it is not as powerful.
20/05/2020, 7:25 pm - Rupali Jain: You still have to use Travis.
20/05/2020, 7:27 pm - +91 99201 75875: Not necessarily
20/05/2020, 7:28 pm - Mudit Verma: Yeah
20/05/2020, 7:29 pm - Rupali Jain: * **I** need to use Travis.
20/05/2020, 7:29 pm - Mudit Verma: Oh okay
20/05/2020, 7:35 pm - Rupali Jain: For eg, I can setup a GitLab CI action to run only when I push to a certain branch, and then automatically build, package and deploy a site, with different production and development instances.
Try doing that with GitLab Actions. Trust me, I have tried.
20/05/2020, 8:05 pm - Samay Raina: Is Git Hub Devops?ü§î

20/05/2020, 9:33 pm - Mudit Verma: Git is a part of DevOps.
GutHub is just a platform.
GitHub has other DevOps features like CI/CD.

@918080142783 am I correct?
20/05/2020, 9:35 pm - Mudit Verma: This can be done with GitHub Actions.

Haven't experimented with CI/CD yet, so you might be right about the complicated nature of GitHub to that of GitLab. I have no idea...
20/05/2020, 9:38 pm - Rupali Jain: Almost.
GitHub has tried to integrate CI/CD into the workflow like GitLab.
20/05/2020, 9:39 pm - Samay Raina: Ohüëç

28/05/2020, 2:27 am - Janvi Rathod: I struggled with Javascript methods of Materialize CSS

28/05/2020, 2:28 am - Rupali Jain: That is why I always advice: *DON'T USE LIBRARIES*.
28/05/2020, 2:28 am - Janvi Rathod: This message was deleted
28/05/2020, 2:28 am - Mudit Verma: Repping for Eddie, huh! Nice!
28/05/2020, 2:28 am - Janvi Rathod: Yuppp
28/05/2020, 2:29 am - Mudit Verma: So plain CSS is the way to go?
28/05/2020, 2:29 am - Mudit Verma: Vanilla* CSS
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Rupali Jain: In my opinion: Always.
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Janvi Rathod: CSS => Complete Suffering & Sadness
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Janvi Rathod: Ohh....
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Rupali Jain: Definitely look to libraries for inspiration, and feel free to copy whatever you like.
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Janvi Rathod: Smart!
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Mudit Verma: Agreed
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Rupali Jain: But I feel that the only time you should be using libraries is for prototypes, never for the final version of an app/website.
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Janvi Rathod: This way, you aren't really using the library, but you also are ......
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Mudit Verma: Ohh
Alright
28/05/2020, 2:32 am - Rupali Jain: ESPECIALLY CSS/JavaScript libraries.
28/05/2020, 2:32 am - Janvi Rathod: Oh ..
28/05/2020, 2:32 am - Mudit Verma: So I should not use Bootstrap, Materialize CSS, Tailwind CSS, etc for my projects...
28/05/2020, 2:33 am - Rupali Jain: Unless the library ADDS critical functionality (eg: PDF parser, WebSocket management) you should think twice before using it.
28/05/2020, 2:33 am - Mudit Verma: Oh
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Rupali Jain: Again, the decision is up to you, but I don't like to use these libraries.
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Rupali Jain: You can achieve the same outcome with 0.1% of the code.
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Rupali Jain: And I am not even joking, try measuring code coverage in DevTools.
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Mudit Verma: What is a CDN is used?
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Mudit Verma: If*
28/05/2020, 2:35 am - Janvi Rathod: We're having real talks at 2.35 AM
This is fucking awesome!!!!!
28/05/2020, 2:35 am - Mudit Verma: üëèüëè
28/05/2020, 2:35 am - Rupali Jain: A CDN can only speed up the download times.
28/05/2020, 2:36 am - Rupali Jain: What I meant that most (small) projects do not even use 2-5% of the code in a huge library like jQuery or BootStrap.
28/05/2020, 2:37 am - Mudit Verma: Agreed, but it only imports the code that is called...

Now if you're saying that that code is a lot as compared to when done with vanilla CSS, then you have to be good at that...

My vanilla CSS with flexbox looks like this:
https://harshkapadia2.github.io/lbl-tribute-page/
28/05/2020, 2:37 am - Rupali Jain: So even if you are using a CDN, and the library is 10,000 lines, then you are only using 100-150 lines.
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Rupali Jain: Which seems like a MASSIVE waste.
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Mudit Verma: It's so garbage that if I used it in my full stack project, no one would come back to it
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Janvi Rathod: You sure do have a point 
But what if, I say I'm not really concerned abt frontend 
I don't want to waste my time adjusting padding and all etc.....

I just want to show off my backend functionality.....
Then what should I do?
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Mudit Verma: The entire lib is called even when just a particular class is called?
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Rupali Jain: If you include a script/library with a <script> or <link> tag, the ENTIRE file is downloaded even if you don't use a single line.
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Rupali Jain: The Browser does not know what you will use, so it HAS to download, parse and execute the entire library.
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Mudit Verma: Oh yeah ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Mudit Verma: True true
28/05/2020, 2:41 am - Rupali Jain: However, there is something called "Tree Shaking" where unused portions of the library are removed.
28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Rupali Jain: But even that is not as efficient because sometimes one function can call half the library.
28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Mudit Verma: Ohh
28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Rupali Jain: And you lose the benefit of a CDN.
28/05/2020, 2:43 am - Janvi Rathod: ?
28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Rupali Jain: OK, what backend functionality?
28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Rupali Jain: Give me an example.
28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Janvi Rathod: Suppose, I'm building a rest api..
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Mudit Verma: Tbh I used a template for Attendance Manager v1
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Mudit Verma: It was just a backend project then...
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Janvi Rathod: Yeahh
You told me once ...
Now I remember....
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Mudit Verma: For v2, we are making the front end ourselves and have redesigned the back end...
28/05/2020, 2:47 am - Rupali Jain: OK, if you are building a REST API, then by all means use BootStrap or Materialize for the demo website.
28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Rupali Jain: But you can still have a great website WITHOUT BootStrap.
28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Mudit Verma: Now here we are using Bootstrap and when we add Flexbox, it fucks up the Bootstrap
28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Mudit Verma: No idea what should be done...
28/05/2020, 2:49 am - Janvi Rathod: Don't use flex box..
Why do you need??
28/05/2020, 2:50 am - Janvi Rathod: Bootstrap handles it all na?
28/05/2020, 2:54 am - Rupali Jain: I try to avoid BootStrap alltogether.
28/05/2020, 2:54 am - Rupali Jain: Try CSS Grid.
28/05/2020, 2:55 am - Janvi Rathod: Ohh that is absolute beauty  .....
28/05/2020, 2:55 am - Janvi Rathod: I've used it ....
28/05/2020, 2:55 am - Janvi Rathod: Its lengthy, 
But it works...
It works perfectly 
It works always....
28/05/2020, 2:56 am - Rupali Jain: Somebody put it nicely: "Grid is how CSS should have been designed in the first place".
28/05/2020, 2:56 am - Janvi Rathod: Now, that you say it.....
28/05/2020, 2:56 am - Janvi Rathod: üî•üî•
28/05/2020, 2:57 am - Janvi Rathod: Are you on Twitter M
28/05/2020, 2:57 am - Janvi Rathod: ?*
28/05/2020, 2:57 am - Rupali Jain: No.
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Janvi Rathod: Oh okay.....
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Rupali Jain: Why?
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Rupali Jain: Is v2 on GitHub?
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Janvi Rathod: Wanted to tag ya
28/05/2020, 2:59 am - Rupali Jain: Oh, ok.
28/05/2020, 2:59 am - Rupali Jain: Also, I am not sure that using a server is important.
28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Rupali Jain: The advantage of not using libraries/frameworks is that the website is MUCH lighter, and hence most of the logic can be offloaded to the client.
28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Rupali Jain: It will greatly reduce the load on the server.
28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Janvi Rathod: Yeah...
28/05/2020, 3:01 am - Janvi Rathod: Also,
It  gives us a better understanding of what actually is happening....
28/05/2020, 3:01 am - Janvi Rathod: You know, what you have coded and 
That's what you are seeing...
Not some pre written code, which you are using.....
28/05/2020, 3:03 am - Janvi Rathod: There's one thing I give you,
The satisfaction of building a complete thing, from scratch, on our own, line by line is üòçüòçüòçüòç
28/05/2020, 3:07 am - Rupali Jain: The satisfaction of finishing a project is much greater.
I would say that if you feel that the only way that you can finish a project is to use a library, then go for it.
But you should definitely try to do at least one project without a library.
28/05/2020, 3:08 am - Janvi Rathod: True!
I'll complete this project, with a library,
But the next one is definitely gonna be VANILLA EVERYTHING
28/05/2020, 3:12 am - Rupali Jain: If you want to try vanilla, your mother's website is a great project.https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp
28/05/2020, 3:12 am - Rupali Jain: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp
28/05/2020, 3:13 am - Rupali Jain: It is better to have a long, scrolling page that has all the images instead of having 5 links that people have to click on.
28/05/2020, 3:13 am - Rupali Jain: That is NEVER a good idea.
28/05/2020, 3:13 am - Rupali Jain: It makes it very difficult to view all the images.
28/05/2020, 3:14 am - Janvi Rathod: Ohhh
28/05/2020, 3:14 am - Janvi Rathod: I thought, it made things easier to view category wise.....
28/05/2020, 3:15 am - Janvi Rathod: If you would have only suggested me before I started!
Anyways...
Next time!
28/05/2020, 3:16 am - Rupali Jain: Yes, but if I want to view all the images, then I have to click on each link, then click 20 times on the >> button.
28/05/2020, 3:17 am - Janvi Rathod: Yaa....
What I'll do is.....
28/05/2020, 3:17 am - Janvi Rathod: I'll create a grid of all images
28/05/2020, 3:17 am - Janvi Rathod: And
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Janvi Rathod: If someone wants to see an enlarged view, I'll add something like a pop-up feature 
When the user clicks on a particular image....
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Rupali Jain: Even now is not too late.
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Rupali Jain: That is exactly what I had in mind.
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Rupali Jain: Like Google Images.
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Janvi Rathod: Yeah...
28/05/2020, 3:19 am - Janvi Rathod: Cool!
My Gallery page is sorted now!
Thanks @918080142783
28/05/2020, 3:19 am - Rupali Jain: No problem.
28/05/2020, 3:19 am - Rupali Jain: Let me know if you need help.
28/05/2020, 3:20 am - Janvi Rathod: Sure!!
28/05/2020, 3:20 am - Rupali Jain: Also, a solid background color is quite boring.
28/05/2020, 3:20 am - Janvi Rathod: It's a gradient....
28/05/2020, 3:21 am - Rupali Jain: What?
28/05/2020, 3:21 am - Janvi Rathod: Yeah....
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Rupali Jain: Well, it looks like a solid color.
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Janvi Rathod: Wait
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Janvi Rathod: Which one are you talking about?
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Janvi Rathod: I'm talking about this one....
28/05/2020, 3:23 am - Rupali Jain: Pick a gradient somewhere like https://uigradients.com/ .
28/05/2020, 3:24 am - Rupali Jain: Oh, I thought you were talking about https://dheerajdlalwani.github.io/ImageGallery/
28/05/2020, 3:24 am - Janvi Rathod: Yeah,
That was old version
28/05/2020, 3:24 am - Rupali Jain: The new one looks good, but the transitions seem a little... too flashy.
28/05/2020, 3:25 am - Rupali Jain: What about a simple, left to right translate?
28/05/2020, 3:25 am - Janvi Rathod: That was like the first thing that popped up in Materialize CSS docsüòÖ
28/05/2020, 3:25 am - Janvi Rathod: I'll change it to that
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Rupali Jain: Is the new website on GitHub?
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Janvi Rathod: Less is always more!
Minimalistic design....
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Janvi Rathod: Yes
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Janvi Rathod: Not hosted though
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Rupali Jain: No problem.
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Janvi Rathod: I'll send the link
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Rupali Jain: Do you know about http://htmlpreview.github.io/
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Janvi Rathod: Noo!
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Janvi Rathod: I'll check it out!
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Janvi Rathod: But, it's a Django project
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Rupali Jain: WHY?
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Janvi Rathod: It's a shop!üòÖ
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Janvi Rathod: E commerce
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Rupali Jain: So?
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Janvi Rathod: I'll be adding payment gateways and all
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Rupali Jain: E - commerce only makes sense if you will be getting at least 10 orders per day.
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Janvi Rathod: For practicing!!!
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Janvi Rathod: üòÖüòÖ
28/05/2020, 3:30 am - Rupali Jain: Last time I checked, the seller registration was like 10,000 per month.
28/05/2020, 3:30 am - Rupali Jain: It might be better to take orders via phone or email.
28/05/2020, 3:30 am - Janvi Rathod: Hm....
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Janvi Rathod: I'm making this project to just explore....
And see how it feels ......
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Janvi Rathod: Getting comfy with the tech...
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Janvi Rathod: My mom takes all orders via phone only.....
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Rupali Jain: Even then, building a payment gateway is not easy.
28/05/2020, 3:32 am - Janvi Rathod: I've to just integrate right?
They're like ready made I saw in some Tutorials.....
28/05/2020, 3:32 am - Rupali Jain: If you seriously want to learn about accepting online payments, then it might be better to look into a payment service like BillDesk or Shopify.
28/05/2020, 3:33 am - Janvi Rathod: Hm.....
28/05/2020, 3:33 am - Rupali Jain: If you only want to integrate with an existing provider then you might be able to use the REST api directly.
28/05/2020, 3:33 am - Rupali Jain: Without the need for a server.
28/05/2020, 3:34 am - Janvi Rathod: Okay...
This is more like PC

This guy has a *GREAT* point

Do reade the complete thread
01/06/2020, 11:59 pm - Mudit Verma: Damn, this is unique!

What are your thoughts @919689727471 and @918408867834?
02/06/2020, 12:00 am - Rupali Jain: I would suggest spending at least 30 minutes on each problem.
02/06/2020, 12:00 am - Rupali Jain: But otherwise, this is great advice.
02/06/2020, 12:01 am - Janvi Rathod: Hmm.....
02/06/2020, 12:12 am - Sanyog Sharma: This can be done for interview questions as they are repetitive. But in Cp, questions aren't that repetitive. Every question has something new. That's why for cp, you have to think for an hour at least on every problem that's hard for you. People spend days solving a single question in CodeChef Long Challenge(8 questions 10 days to solve). Questions are hard. But you get learn 5-6 different concepts by solving a single question.
02/06/2020, 12:14 am - Mudit Verma: This is if you're doing it for the love of CP, right? Would you recommend this for interviews as well?
02/06/2020, 12:15 am - Anjali Kapoor: If you want to do hardcore cp then this might good for starting
02/06/2020, 12:15 am - Anjali Kapoor: This is what i think
02/06/2020, 12:17 am - Sanyog Sharma: I haven't started with interview questions yet. But yeah you should think for an hour at least. That'll improve your problem solving skills. And in interviews, they won't ask you questions which are already there on gfg(for FAANG companies). They'll always slightly change the question. To solve the question during interview you should have excellent problem solving skills.
02/06/2020, 12:18 am - Mudit Verma: üëçüëç
02/06/2020, 12:18 am - Sanyog Sharma: FAANG=Facebook, Amazon,Apple, Netflix, Google
02/06/2020, 12:33 am - Janvi Rathod: They will not ask the same questions,
But the flavor might be the same right?
Like similar algo but, different applications?

05/06/2020, 4:02 pm - Rupali Jain: But I think that it should not be too difficult.
05/06/2020, 4:03 pm - Rupali Jain: So can someone please test this on an EMULATOR. I don't want to factory reset mine.
05/06/2020, 4:03 pm - Rupali Jain: https://www.ubackground.com/wallpaper/nature/lake_mountain_sunset/17-0-19786
05/06/2020, 4:03 pm - Samay Raina: üòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:05 pm - Janvi Rathod: You're tempting me to download on my phone üôÑüôÑ
05/06/2020, 4:05 pm - Janvi Rathod: Almost downloaded itüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:05 pm - Samay Raina: Delete that link

Before I download üòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:08 pm - +91 86559 19035: Usme bas ek pixel ka issue hai all the max values for RGB pixel are 255 and there's a formula to calculate the number for each R G B pixel and it actually comes around 254 and due to approximation of the formula to the nearest integer in Android it calculate the value as 256 and when you apply it you are screwed
It's prophoto RGB image so don't try it out
05/06/2020, 4:08 pm - Rupali Jain: Also, I wanted to check if using a custom launcher (like Nova Launcher) affects things.
05/06/2020, 4:09 pm - +91 86559 19035: Nope it won't
05/06/2020, 4:09 pm - Rupali Jain: Why?
05/06/2020, 4:10 pm - +91 86559 19035: When You set a wallpaper it is set in your system even if the app crashes the wallpaper won't change since you set it and there starts the loop crashes
05/06/2020, 4:14 pm - Rupali Jain: The issue is that the system restarts the home process, which crashes, then restarts, then crashes, etc.
05/06/2020, 4:14 pm - +91 86559 19035: Loop yes
05/06/2020, 4:15 pm - Rupali Jain: If the wallpaper is a third party launcher, then the system will use the default home process.
05/06/2020, 4:17 pm - +91 86559 19035: Go ahead try to install a launcher apply a wallpaper not that one and then uninstall the launcher the wallpaper stays the same
05/06/2020, 4:17 pm - +91 86559 19035: Same matlab jo launcher se apply kiya tha
05/06/2020, 4:22 pm - Samay Raina: This message was deleted
05/06/2020, 4:22 pm - Samay Raina: read the comments sectionüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:24 pm - Rupali Jain: On my (Oppo) phone, whenever Nova Launcher crashes, the launcher changes to the system launcher, and the wallpaper resets.
05/06/2020, 4:24 pm - +91 86559 19035: You may try applying your luck then
05/06/2020, 4:25 pm - Rupali Jain: Most definately NOT.
05/06/2020, 4:25 pm - Rupali Jain: That is why I am asking someone to try in an emulator.
05/06/2020, 4:35 pm - Samay Raina: Send this to Kajli ma'am @917738557601
05/06/2020, 4:36 pm - Samay Raina: Problem solve teraüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:38 pm - Rupali Jain: I am not sure that she is capable of setting a wallpaper üòÇ.
05/06/2020, 4:38 pm - Samay Raina: Downloading it is enough na
05/06/2020, 4:38 pm - Rupali Jain: No, it has to be SET as a wallpaper.
05/06/2020, 4:39 pm - Rupali Jain: * or displayed by the system in some manner, but then the system can just kill the task.
05/06/2020, 4:50 pm - +91 99693 94098: I'll try this when I get some time. Sounds like fun
If anything goes wrong, nandroid backup wtg üòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:53 pm - Rupali Jain: All of you know how to use an emulator, right?
05/06/2020, 4:55 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yup
05/06/2020, 4:56 pm - Rupali Jain: Then WHY do you want to experiment on your phone?
05/06/2020, 4:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: Because I want to wipe it anyway before I permanently switch to Paranoid Android so might as well try this out
Plus this doesn't crash all phones so who knows ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:57 pm - Rupali Jain: OK that makes sense.
05/06/2020, 4:58 pm - Rupali Jain: I prefer Lineange OS.
05/06/2020, 4:58 pm - +91 99693 94098: Lineage is too plain for my taste üòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: Also a nandroid backup is an ultimate backup so it's nothing more than a simple experiment
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - Rupali Jain: Then try Resurrection Remix (RR).
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: That's outdated. No Q build either
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - Rupali Jain: I know, but it is still better to NOT brick your phone.
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: RR hasn't been updated for a very long time actually
05/06/2020, 5:00 pm - +91 99693 94098: I've bricked mine wayyy too many times üòÇüòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:00 pm - +91 99693 94098: Even had to go to stores to replace the motherboard a couple of times
05/06/2020, 5:03 pm - Rupali Jain: https://get.resurrectionremix.com/?dir=ten
05/06/2020, 5:04 pm - Rupali Jain: Very few devices are supported, but you can find unofficial roms on androidfilehost.com
05/06/2020, 5:05 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know that already buddy
05/06/2020, 5:06 pm - +91 99693 94098: And I don't want to build on my own so I'm just avoiding it
05/06/2020, 5:06 pm - +91 88798 05171: rr is pretty old now, devs stopped compiling it because it was pretty unstable
05/06/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 88798 05171: and obv new roms came out which were better
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: I spoke to Akhil Narang who has a big contribution in RR and he said the same thing
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: The best ROM imo is AOSiP
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: Nothing beats it
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 88798 05171: ive been into this shit since galaxy yüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:09 pm - Rupali Jain: Well, the last build was on 1 June, so I don't know.
05/06/2020, 5:09 pm - +91 99693 94098: Same üòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:09 pm - +91 99693 94098: Why wouldn't they merge the security patch and release it instead? ü§î

05/06/2020, 5:10 pm - Vikram Nandal: I think galaxy young or something it was called

05/06/2020, 5:24 pm - +91 99693 94098: There was a themer called good lock or something. That was the best thing that came out if samsung at that time üòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:35 pm - Vikram Nandal: I think was part of Samsung theme park/manager whatever they called... üòÇ

05/06/2020, 5:39 pm - Vikram Nandal: Future of Futchia OS seems nice now but biggest issue is unlike android which works on Linux based kernel it works on Google made custom microkernel I think which makes providing apps on App Store difficult if google is able to nail the process of transfer of apps it would be replacing android then...
05/06/2020, 5:40 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya... a lot don‚Äôt use google chrome browser use our Samsung browser.. don‚Äôt use EA file explorer use Samsung files and so on lots of dual apps too... üòÇ

05/06/2020, 5:44 pm - Janvi Rathod: S. Voice was the shittiest.
05/06/2020, 5:45 pm - Janvi Rathod: Bixby was promising, but 
Google Assistant ruled the assistant world.
05/06/2020, 5:45 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya... remember now it lacked basic core reminder setting features too üòÇ Bixby is much better in comparison..
05/06/2020, 5:46 pm - Janvi Rathod: Yeah üòÇ

05/06/2020, 5:47 pm - Samay Raina: Seen*
05/06/2020, 5:48 pm - Janvi Rathod: No matter, how much ever shitty Samsung is,
I'd always prefer Samsung over MIUI or Huawei or any other crappy Chinese OS
05/06/2020, 5:48 pm - Samay Raina: True
05/06/2020, 5:48 pm - Samay Raina: What happened to Freedom 257 thingüòÇ

05/06/2020, 5:49 pm - Samay Raina: Yes,it turns out it was some shitty Chinese phone
05/06/2020, 5:50 pm - Janvi Rathod: The worst scandal going on rn is the Escobar Inc. Wala üòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:50 pm - Janvi Rathod: Google it once

MKBHD's & Mr. Who's The Boss's video
05/06/2020, 5:50 pm - Vikram Nandal: Agreed... but not for that alone, Samsung‚Äôs r and d team is awesome no fold would have been possible without Samsung and there would be no edge/curved display devices without them they keep competition going if only Apple were there... u know üòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:51 pm - Janvi Rathod: Yeahh
05/06/2020, 5:51 pm - Vikram Nandal: Saw re.. They are biggest scam
05/06/2020, 5:52 pm - +91 99693 94098: True. Mi is so shit that you have to ask for their permission for bootloader unlock and uske baad bhi you have to wait for a minimum of 15days before you can actually do it. Biggest scam ever
05/06/2020, 5:53 pm - Vikram Nandal: I loved their irony buying ripapple.com and rip Samsung.com and selling their refurbished phones only by rebranding themüòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:54 pm - +91 88798 05171: But they have everything you want
05/06/2020, 5:54 pm - Vikram Nandal: These days I think all phones do it started by moto and Lenovo but it improves Androids privacy by having a locked bootloader it‚Äôs actually good as it makes hard to exploit a device with locked bootloader
05/06/2020, 5:55 pm - +91 88798 05171: There's no developement for op7
05/06/2020, 5:55 pm - +91 88798 05171: Its my first unrooted phoneüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:56 pm - +91 99693 94098: 15 days wait time for a phone that I bought? Why can't I just unlock it immediately if I want to? Your device is linked to your mi account anyway so there's no way anyone else can do it
05/06/2020, 5:56 pm - +91 99693 94098: There is so much development for op7
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know like 3-4 main devs that develop for op7
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 88798 05171: Thats for pro
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: Nahi nahi
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 88798 05171: Been a while I've checked XDA
05/06/2020, 5:58 pm - +91 99693 94098: Karle. Kaafi saare ROMs hai OP7 ke liye
05/06/2020, 5:59 pm - +91 88798 05171: Jab mene dekha tha tab lineage tak nahi tha
05/06/2020, 6:01 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know op7 ka PE dev. Baalaji. He used to develop for my device before
05/06/2020, 6:01 pm - Vikram Nandal: Moto and pixel give code immediately though. See bootloader is a integral part of os without its correct flashing device does not work. If ur device came with preunlocked bootloader biggest issue comes with sim locked devices in USA they can be easily exploited and this is how telephone providers were loosing lot of money. This is when moto started with locked bootloader and see xda forums nobody has found exploit for it yet. Also unlocked bootloader gives u permission to flash custom recovery after custom recovery u install custom rom and bam u bypass mi account wala lock and now u can use the stolen phones that‚Äôs the reason locked bootloader are better
05/06/2020, 6:02 pm - Vikram Nandal: Lineage OS surely would be there as lots of old CYnogen mod developers working on lineage OS and one plus and cynogen go way back
05/06/2020, 6:04 pm - +91 88798 05171: tele group nikal na op7 ka, xda doesnt even have an official lineage thread
05/06/2020, 6:04 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know this re üòÇüòÇ
I'm saying that all phones have a security check before you can unlock(some kind of login or something) so no random person can do it. If you're giving your login credentials and you're still not able to unlock the bootloader immediately then what's the use? 
Flashing a custom recovery, etc comes much later. ADB doesn't allow that anyway before you unlock the bootlader

05/06/2020, 6:06 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya... now providing what moto calls unique key for bootloader unlocking that‚Äôs up to manufacturer re. Before doing that they have too check if device has valid purchase date etc now moto does it on site and gives code immediately I have never tried on mi device that‚Äôs issue with xiomi
05/06/2020, 6:07 pm - Janvi Rathod: Shit going above head again üòÇ
05/06/2020, 6:07 pm - +91 99693 94098: That's much better imo
05/06/2020, 6:07 pm - +91 88798 05171: 1 saal hogaya twrp nahi dekha hoga
05/06/2020, 6:07 pm - +91 99693 94098: Try orangefox if your device has it. 10x better than twrp
05/06/2020, 6:07 pm - +91 88798 05171: ye kab aayaüòÇ
05/06/2020, 6:07 pm - Vikram Nandal: ?
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - Vikram Nandal: Orange fox?
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 88798 05171: might be a recovery
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: Rip I guess op7 doesn't have it
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yes
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - Vikram Nandal: It would have pixel experience rom see that‚Äôs a lot popular on one plus devices these days
05/06/2020, 6:09 pm - +91 99693 94098: It's literally one step away from being a ROM itself üòÇüòÇ
Bas wifi and data connectivity daalde and done
05/06/2020, 6:09 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yes PE is amazing
05/06/2020, 6:09 pm - Vikram Nandal: Never heard much I think twrp and clockwork mod ruled the game back in the days
05/06/2020, 6:09 pm - Samay Raina: +1
05/06/2020, 6:09 pm - +91 88798 05171: hardlly anyone does these stuff on op devices

05/06/2020, 6:10 pm - Samay Raina: I will search all of these today for sure
05/06/2020, 6:11 pm - Vikram Nandal: I know re... not using android so stop this kand these days.. üòÇ and issue with jailbreaking is Apple keeps pushing iOS updates so quickly that the the exploit becomes useless. Hence xda article on why jailbreaking community is dying
05/06/2020, 6:12 pm - Samay Raina: Pehli baar kucj smjhaüòå
05/06/2020, 6:12 pm - +91 99693 94098: Ask them to update safari ffs üòÇüòÇ
All web devs are crying because safari doesn't support half of the things
05/06/2020, 6:13 pm - Vikram Nandal: They don‚Äôt care truly and actually btw safari has web inspector on Mac though not as good as chrome developer tools nowhere near actually üòÇüòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 6:15 pm - +91 88798 05171: pe has v limited customisations na
05/06/2020, 6:16 pm - Rupali Jain: I like the design of the FireFox devtools more.
But Chrome devtools has some great features.
05/06/2020, 6:16 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yes. Like Lineage
05/06/2020, 6:17 pm - +91 88798 05171: not for me then
05/06/2020, 6:17 pm - +91 99693 94098: Apparently Henrique ported face unlock for Q from some moto phone and moto sent him a notice üòÇüòÇ
Uske baad se abhi koi moto ke phones ko bhaav nahi de raha
05/06/2020, 6:18 pm - Vikram Nandal: Yup.. chrome is best Never tried Firefox accept on all Linux distros
05/06/2020, 6:20 pm - Vikram Nandal: I know... issue with moto is that only walls are built very high I was reading this article on sim unlocking on moto USA devices apparently I guy wrote a python script that gave the unique key for such device and was sued by moto.. he stoped now
05/06/2020, 6:20 pm - Rupali Jain: <Media omitted>
05/06/2020, 6:21 pm - +91 99693 94098: One plus is great in that sense. Source code nahi denge but jo masti karna hai karlo üòÇ

05/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Vikram Nandal: Arey.. this is a scam brother Escobar sends refurbished devices to their reviewers only
05/06/2020, 6:22 pm - +91 88798 05171: aur unka oos
05/06/2020, 6:22 pm - +91 88798 05171: sabse buggy

05/06/2020, 6:22 pm - +91 88798 05171: every use has their unique bugs
05/06/2020, 6:22 pm - +91 99693 94098: OOS is pretty sorted I feel. Atleast when compared to memeui
05/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Rupali Jain: I don't like iOS anyways. Too limited.

10/06/2020, 6:10 pm - Janvi Rathod: Because it is not bloated with BS
10/06/2020, 6:10 pm - Anjali Kapoor: What do you use for development?
10/06/2020, 6:10 pm - Janvi Rathod: Windows

10/06/2020, 6:11 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Don't dual boot

10/06/2020, 6:13 pm - Mudit Verma: Why lol
10/06/2020, 6:13 pm - Anjali Kapoor: What i think it's because linux support some functionality which inbuilt for easy working
10/06/2020, 6:13 pm - Samay Raina: +1

10/06/2020, 6:14 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Idk i also use windows for buildingüòÖ
10/06/2020, 6:14 pm - Mudit Verma: Same lol
10/06/2020, 6:15 pm - Anjali Kapoor: This is what i have heard
10/06/2020, 6:15 pm - Samay Raina: Yes me too
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Mudit Verma: I mean go ahead, it's your choice.

Also, WSL2 is out (if you've updated to Win 10 version 2004), so you can start using the new Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with it and also use the new Windows Terminal.

Hmu if you need any help with that. I have done it myself and have gists with all the reqd links and stuff...
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Do you make gists for everything you do?
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Mudit Verma: Yes

10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Mudit Verma: Documentation is VERY important!
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Rupali Jain: Personally, could not recommed Docker highly enough.
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I'm not really good mdüòÖ
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Rupali Jain: MUCH better than WSL, as you can have separate, disposable containers.
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Mudit Verma: Oh yeah even Docker is amazing and it's supported via a nice GUI if you've updated to Win 10 version 2004.
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Rupali Jain: GUI?
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Rupali Jain: What GUI?
10/06/2020, 6:23 pm - Mudit Verma: Docker has started supporting Win 10 Home as well
10/06/2020, 6:23 pm - Rupali Jain: Yes, that is with VirtualBox.
10/06/2020, 6:24 pm - Mudit Verma: I think they did away with that in the 2004 version. Not sure though...
10/06/2020, 6:24 pm - Rupali Jain: But updataing to Pro is trivial.

https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/KMS-activator
10/06/2020, 6:24 pm - Rupali Jain: 10/10 would recommend.
10/06/2020, 6:25 pm - Rupali Jain: Especially if you want to work with large projects.
10/06/2020, 6:25 pm - Mudit Verma: Yeah I never said that you should upgrade to Pro
10/06/2020, 6:25 pm - Mudit Verma: Explain this is simple terms lol
10/06/2020, 6:29 pm - Rupali Jain: Windows has an in-built mechanic to check activation with *any* Key Management Server (KMS).
This is usually used in corporate enviorments where internet access is a security issue.
But you can setup a KMS server ON THE SAME PC and Windows will happily ask the server if the liscence is still valid.
10/06/2020, 6:30 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Is it like piracy?
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Mudit Verma: Oh lol üòÇ
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Mudit Verma: Why have they not done something to solve it!?
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Rupali Jain: So the exchange goes like this:
Windows to Server: Is my license still valid?
Server to Windows: Of course! üòâ
Windows: OK then.
10/06/2020, 6:32 pm - Mudit Verma: üòÇ
10/06/2020, 6:32 pm - Rupali Jain: Yes, but you are not modifying the software, just using in-built mechanisms in un-intended ways.
10/06/2020, 6:32 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Ironically it is hosted on GitHubüòÇüòÇ
10/06/2020, 6:33 pm - Rupali Jain: Yes. But not a lot of people know about this or have the patience to read the README.
10/06/2020, 6:34 pm - Mudit Verma: üòÖ
10/06/2020, 6:50 pm - Rupali Jain: That will be VERY difficult, since Microsoft mainly relys on the backwords-compatibility of Windows. Otherwise all businesses would have switched to Linux.
10/06/2020, 6:50 pm - Rupali Jain: You can actually run a Windows 98 program on Windows 10 and it shoud run fine.
10/06/2020, 6:50 pm - Rupali Jain: PS: This works for Office as well.

12/06/2020, 9:31 pm - Rupali Jain: No.
12/06/2020, 9:31 pm - Samay Raina: <Media omitted>
12/06/2020, 9:31 pm - Rupali Jain: Log mujhe puch rahe hai ki mai kaha ja raha hu. üòÇ
12/06/2020, 9:32 pm - Samay Raina: Anyway best of luck man!
12/06/2020, 9:32 pm - Rupali Jain: Thanks.

12/06/2020, 10:23 pm - Samay Raina: Dude why don't you use an IDE like IntelliJ ,it will be easier to debug then
12/06/2020, 10:25 pm - Samay Raina: int x is not declared
12/06/2020, 10:25 pm - Mithun Kapoor: X is not defined inside prime
12/06/2020, 10:25 pm - Samay Raina: Yes
12/06/2020, 10:36 pm - Janvi Rathod: Actually, he is doing a great job.
12/06/2020, 10:37 pm - Samay Raina: Yes getting used to command line...but as a beginner better to use an IDE like BlueJ
12/06/2020, 10:38 pm - Anjali Kapoor: But no one is going to tell you that their should be written in a notepad or something
12/06/2020, 10:38 pm - Rupali Jain: I too like to use the command line for simple programs, but USE AN EDITOR.
Notepad++ is a good standalone editor. So is VSCode.
But DON'T USE NOTEPAD.
12/06/2020, 10:39 pm - Samay Raina: True
12/06/2020, 10:40 pm - Anjali Kapoor: IDE's help you a lot!!!
12/06/2020, 10:43 pm - Janvi Rathod: Exactly 
You don't want the beginner to get too much help
12/06/2020, 10:44 pm - Samay Raina: Then you use Bluej
12/06/2020, 10:44 pm - Samay Raina: Its just perfect,just like a text editor,no auto-complete
12/06/2020, 10:46 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Why??üôÑüò∂
12/06/2020, 10:46 pm - Janvi Rathod: The beginner should be able to figure it out himself, where he went wrong 
Rather than the ide just helping him fix the errors
12/06/2020, 10:47 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Ide does show you the errors
12/06/2020, 10:53 pm - Anjali Kapoor: And getting stuck at such a trivial issues is so demotivating for a beginner
12/06/2020, 10:54 pm - Samay Raina: This is true
12/06/2020, 11:04 pm - Janvi Rathod: I know 
Been there....
But, 
I also used an IDE only....
12/06/2020, 11:05 pm - Janvi Rathod: But I realized, in order to get perfect....
I would have done better if I had done it on a simple text editor
12/06/2020, 11:05 pm - Janvi Rathod: Do watch Tech With Tim's video on this topic
12/06/2020, 11:06 pm - Janvi Rathod: https://youtu.be/oij82Cp9K1A
12/06/2020, 11:07 pm - Janvi Rathod: I feel that 
Immediate help is harmful
12/06/2020, 11:07 pm - Rupali Jain: Notepad++ provides only syntax highlighting. I think that is a quite helpfully, especially for a beginner.
12/06/2020, 11:08 pm - Samay Raina: Bluej is the best for beginners imo,we used that in school too
12/06/2020, 11:09 pm - Rupali Jain: Not using an IDE is like learning to ride a bike without training wheels.
Yes, it is possible but there is no major benefit.
12/06/2020, 11:14 pm - Anjali Kapoor: True that
12/06/2020, 11:17 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Which language?
12/06/2020, 11:17 pm - Janvi Rathod: Python
12/06/2020, 11:17 pm - Janvi Rathod: C++
12/06/2020, 11:19 pm - Rupali Jain: I find Python impossible to code without an IDE.
Especially without a mononspace font. I really don't like the syntax.
12/06/2020, 11:19 pm - Janvi Rathod: Ahh
I know thatüòÖüòÖ
12/06/2020, 11:20 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Python have a really steep learning curve for people from another language which have brackets
12/06/2020, 11:21 pm - Anjali Kapoor: It's very hard to get used to those whitespaces
12/06/2020, 11:21 pm - Rupali Jain: Its not just the whitespaces, Python has vary strange behaviour.
12/06/2020, 11:21 pm - Rupali Jain: *very.
12/06/2020, 11:22 pm - Anjali Kapoor: IküòÇ
12/06/2020, 11:22 pm - Rupali Jain: I cannot do ```"I have " + 5 + " Apples"```.
12/06/2020, 11:22 pm - Samay Raina: ü§£
12/06/2020, 11:23 pm - Rupali Jain: But I call a function with missing arguments?
12/06/2020, 11:23 pm - Anjali Kapoor: üòÇüòÇ
12/06/2020, 11:23 pm - Samay Raina: Im uncomfortable with Python syntax frü§£
12/06/2020, 11:24 pm - Rupali Jain: JAVA ALLOWS THIS.
C++ ALLOWS THIS.
BOTH ARE MORE STRONGLY TYPED THAN PYTHON.
12/06/2020, 11:24 pm - Rupali Jain: And initializing multi-dimension arrays is horrible.
12/06/2020, 11:24 pm - Anjali Kapoor: If you are using a statically typed language ide helps a lot
12/06/2020, 11:25 pm - Rupali Jain: If you are using a ~statically typed~ language ide helps a lot.
12/06/2020, 11:26 pm - Anjali Kapoor: And i can't find a reason of not using an ide if you are always going to use an ide
12/06/2020, 11:26 pm - Janvi Rathod: Y'all, hating python so much makes me sad 
ü•∫ü•∫
üëâüèªüëàüèªüëâüèªüëàüèª
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Rupali Jain: Python has a statement to do nothing.
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Aww we don't hate youüòÇ
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Janvi Rathod: Watch the video
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Janvi Rathod: .
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Janvi Rathod: Thanks!
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I watched this
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Janvi Rathod: Oh
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Samay Raina: Idk why but I really hate Python
12/06/2020, 11:28 pm - Janvi Rathod: Dream come trueüòÇ
Now, to do nothing also, I'm accounted for üòÇ
12/06/2020, 11:28 pm - Samay Raina: Another disadvantage that its Dynamically typed
12/06/2020, 11:29 pm - Janvi Rathod: <Media omitted>
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Rupali Jain: It is a good learning experience, you should know how to compile programs.
Syntax hilighing is a different story.
There is no good reason to not use syntax hilighting.
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Samay Raina: I have literally seen solutions in Perl which kill a huge solution in a line
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Janvi Rathod: Yeah...
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Samay Raina: On codeforces
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I never wrote a line of code without an ide but still ik what error I'm getting. What i feel is that learning a language takes time but demotivating yourself of by getting stuck at simple issues is not acceptable.
12/06/2020, 11:31 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Yes
12/06/2020, 11:31 pm - Rupali Jain: It is less about the error and more about knowing how to work with simple tools.
12/06/2020, 11:32 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I gave example of error
12/06/2020, 11:32 pm - Janvi Rathod: Syntax highlighting is necessary 
But, 
Autocomplete nahi yaar...
I've grown so used to it
That 
I keep forgetting the syntax
12/06/2020, 11:34 pm - Rupali Jain: Except in certain circumstances (Static code analysis), all the IDE does is display the error thrown by the compiler in a different way.
You should know how to read throught logs and error messages to find what is relevant.
12/06/2020, 11:35 pm - Samay Raina: Its a nightmare to read the logs
12/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Ganda hai par dhanda haiüòÇüòÇ
12/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Rupali Jain: > I keep forgetting the syntax
There is NO GOOD REASON to remember syntax. Can you remember every word in the dictionary? Then why do you want to memorize an entire language
12/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Samay Raina: Interview purpose
12/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Anjali Kapoor: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12/06/2020, 11:39 pm - Rupali Jain: There is a function in JavaScript, setTimeout
I can never remember if it is ```setTimeout(function, time)``` or ```setTimeout(time, function)```.
I look it up whenever I need to.
12/06/2020, 11:39 pm - Samay Raina: Ham JavaScript tak pahuche hi nahiüôà
12/06/2020, 11:39 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Bhai ds or algo hai na or kya chea inko
12/06/2020, 11:39 pm - Samay Raina: Yes
12/06/2020, 11:39 pm - Janvi Rathod: I agree 
That coding is about 
How better your Googling Skills are....

But for the sake of efficiency
12/06/2020, 11:40 pm - Janvi Rathod: If, we have this rigid practice of typing out the whole code.....
12/06/2020, 11:40 pm - Samay Raina: For projects,hell no
12/06/2020, 11:40 pm - Janvi Rathod: Then, couple that with the autocomplete
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Samay Raina: This makes it faster
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Janvi Rathod: Couple the practice with autocomplete 
Your efficiency increases √ó3
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Janvi Rathod: Exactly
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Janvi Rathod: Obviously
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Janvi Rathod: I'm saying 
While learning basics of coding
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Janvi Rathod: Initial stages
12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Samay Raina: Yes
12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Janvi Rathod: When, we are learning the fundamentals
12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Janvi Rathod: If, we get used to autocomplete
12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Janvi Rathod: Then we won't learn the language
12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Janvi Rathod: Properly
12/06/2020, 11:43 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Bhai but you will always have autocomplete
12/06/2020, 11:43 pm - Rupali Jain: Yaar example de raha tha.
12/06/2020, 11:43 pm - Samay Raina: Smjh gaua
12/06/2020, 11:44 pm - Anjali Kapoor: And we don't need to know all the functions and parms
12/06/2020, 11:44 pm - Samay Raina: Java mai bhi huge functions , can't remember
12/06/2020, 11:44 pm - Samay Raina: All
12/06/2020, 11:44 pm - Janvi Rathod: Agreed bhai
12/06/2020, 11:45 pm - Janvi Rathod: Just for initial stages yaar.....
12/06/2020, 11:45 pm - Anjali Kapoor: @918451904417 if you are going to learn a new language are you going to use notepad again?
12/06/2020, 11:45 pm - Janvi Rathod: Not note pad
But yes notepad++
12/06/2020, 11:45 pm - Janvi Rathod: Planning to use for Golang
12/06/2020, 11:46 pm - Anjali Kapoor: And remember all the syntax of all languages you know?
12/06/2020, 11:46 pm - Janvi Rathod: Cause, 
I messed up my initial learning
12/06/2020, 11:46 pm - Janvi Rathod: Obviously not everything
12/06/2020, 11:47 pm - Janvi Rathod: But, yes
Atleast some of it
12/06/2020, 11:47 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Whats the use of it?
12/06/2020, 11:47 pm - Janvi Rathod: Dude,
There was a time I forgot how to print in C
12/06/2020, 11:48 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Google baba?üòÇ
12/06/2020, 11:48 pm - Janvi Rathod: Exactly 
Time waste hua na
12/06/2020, 11:49 pm - Anjali Kapoor: But u learnt c in codeblocks if I'm not wrong?
12/06/2020, 11:49 pm - Janvi Rathod: No.

Phuket exaggeration
12/06/2020, 11:52 pm - Janvi Rathod: That's because 
It's  was more optimized for using with a keyboard

12/06/2020, 11:52 pm - Janvi Rathod: My 11th 12th teacher explained me that
12/06/2020, 11:53 pm - Janvi Rathod: It was never meant to be used with a mouse
12/06/2020, 11:53 pm - Janvi Rathod: True that....
But....
12/06/2020, 11:53 pm - Samay Raina: In 11/12th..... attendance marke I used to escape from my tutorials to learn JEEü§£

I would suggest switching to VS Code for web dev though. Lmk if you want links to set up VS Code (extensions and stuff).

You might miss out on the nitty gritties of the particular language. But that's fine.
For beginners, what should do is, find a course which teaches by walking through a particular project. That would be really beneficial.
25/06/2020, 11:37 pm - Mudit Verma: Definitely agree with this!

Chrome was the first browser to bring the concept of Threading.

Before that, in firefox, if there are 10 tabs open and if 1 tab also stops working 
It used to crash the browser.

26/06/2020, 12:01 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Edge chromium is just WOW
26/06/2020, 12:02 pm - +91 86559 19035: Yeah still Chrome will be kinda default for most (maybe?)
26/06/2020, 12:02 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Atleast not of me
26/06/2020, 12:03 pm - +91 86559 19035: üëç
26/06/2020, 12:03 pm - Mudit Verma: Yeah, but people are slowly migrating imo.

Brave, Edge, Firefox and some of the popular ones...

I personally use Edge because Microsoft atleast optimizes its perf (even though it is Chromium)
26/06/2020, 12:03 pm - Mudit Verma: Are*
26/06/2020, 12:04 pm - +91 86559 19035: Yeah True
26/06/2020, 12:04 pm - Anjali Kapoor: True that
26/06/2020, 12:04 pm - Mudit Verma: @918080142783 will probably counter me on this...
26/06/2020, 12:05 pm - Sanyog Sharma: üòÇüòÇ
26/06/2020, 12:05 pm - Anjali Kapoor: My reason for migrating from chrome is, it's made by Google....
26/06/2020, 12:11 pm - Mudit Verma: I feel you
I really do
26/06/2020, 12:33 pm - +91 80979 84068: Hi guys! 

So I was thinking most of us want to start with ML ,DAta science , AI but don‚Äôt exactly know where to start from, so I‚Äôm forming a group where we‚Äôll start working on projects together . We‚Äôll start with v basic projects starting from Python ke basics and will go on aage (ITS OKAY IF YOU DON‚ÄôT KNOW MUCH WE ALL ARE LEARNING HERE ) 

- we will refer to 1YouTube video focusing on 1 project for a week and try to make and learn on our own . 
- if we don‚Äôt understand any concept or anything from the video we‚Äôlltry to reverse engineer it and help others in the group as well.

People who are interested can join this group

 You all can share it with people if you want

26/06/2020, 12:41 pm - Rupali Jain: I mostly use Chrome or FireFox.
Chrome becuase you cannot deny the rapid pace of new features.
FireFox because it is open source.
26/06/2020, 12:41 pm - Rupali Jain: Let us hope that the browser market becomes more diverse.
26/06/2020, 12:42 pm - Rupali Jain: It is never good to have a monopoly.

 Also I was thinking it‚Äôll be great if we put up our projects on GitHub as it‚Äôll help us keep a record of our progress so Harsh Kapadia‚Å© has decided to help us with Git and GitHub. He will be taking a live hands on session tomorrow(ie Sunday)
and I have posted a poll  regarding the same there please join the group and vote so we know when to keep the session

28/06/2020, 9:23 pm - +91 75078 05454: This looks interesting. But it looks like a customisable yet limited platform specifically created for development of apps for internal business use something like a project management app.
28/06/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 75078 05454: It's an interesting move of Amazon's part. They are trying to migrate people who are using Google docs or microsoft excel to this platform which is powered by AWS.
28/06/2020, 9:25 pm - Rupali Jain: How exactly/
28/06/2020, 9:26 pm - Rupali Jain: This is an app development platform, right?
28/06/2020, 9:26 pm - Rupali Jain: Not an Excel or Google Sheets clone.
28/06/2020, 9:29 pm - +91 75078 05454: Businesses use spreadsheets for managing projects that is what they are trying to replace.
28/06/2020, 9:29 pm - +91 75078 05454: Not something like data analysis or financial analysis done using spreadsheets
28/06/2020, 9:33 pm - +91 75078 05454: They are basically trying to solve the problem of using spreadsheets where they are not supposed to be conventionally used .
28/06/2020, 9:33 pm - Rupali Jain: OK, that makes some sense.
28/06/2020, 9:36 pm - Samay Raina: üëçüëç

28/06/2020, 9:53 pm - +91 75078 05454: What is your opinion?
28/06/2020, 10:02 pm - +91 75078 05454: The real goal is definitely not to be an excel clone but to provide an effective way of creating apps for internal operations
28/06/2020, 10:03 pm - Rupali Jain: My point exactly.
28/06/2020, 10:04 pm - +91 75078 05454: But they are going to have a huge advantage once the entire company moves to their platform for all internal operations
28/06/2020, 10:04 pm - Rupali Jain: While this is certainly possible, I don't think that this is the first use-case to come to mind.
28/06/2020, 10:05 pm - +91 75078 05454: ?
28/06/2020, 10:07 pm - Rupali Jain: I mean that it is possible to do data-analysis and manage projects on the platform, but that is not what I would use the platform for.
28/06/2020, 10:08 pm - Rupali Jain: I would use it for rapid prototypes and proof of concepts.
28/06/2020, 10:08 pm - +91 75078 05454: That's definitely a very good use case but depends on the capability of the platform
28/06/2020, 10:09 pm - +91 75078 05454: From their campaign it looks like a platform for making apps for internal operations for businesses
28/06/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 75078 05454: But there is definitely a possibility of that turning into something like WordPress
28/06/2020, 10:11 pm - Rupali Jain: I feel that Wordpress gained it's popularity because it was so open.
28/06/2020, 10:12 pm - +91 75078 05454: That's what I am saying the range of use cases will depend upon the flexibility of the platform
28/06/2020, 10:13 pm - Rupali Jain: That is true.
28/06/2020, 10:14 pm - Rupali Jain: But I don't think that companies will be willing to trust Amazon with their business logic.
28/06/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 75078 05454: Yeah that's true
28/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Mudit Verma: Same. Even I was surprised when I read that üòÇ

Mujhe decimal point ke baad 1000 numbers chahiye for example toh kaise karu
01/07/2020, 5:14 pm - Sanyog Sharma: F aaisa kya kar raha hai?
01/07/2020, 5:14 pm - +91 75078 05454: Yeh competition ka question hai naa?
01/07/2020, 5:15 pm - +91 73043 57388: Yes
01/07/2020, 5:15 pm - +91 73043 57388: Actually i am getting

Only 5 numbers after . Point
01/07/2020, 5:16 pm - +91 75078 05454: I tried by importing Decimal in python
01/07/2020, 5:16 pm - +91 99204 26955: try fixed and set precision I guess
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: Ya but it seems they are only used while printing a double number

I wanna store number
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - shivika malik: This message was deleted
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 75078 05454: I converted it to a string
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - Janvi Rathod: You will have to use arrays.
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - Janvi Rathod: Or a string.
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - Sanyog Sharma: hmm
01/07/2020, 5:21 pm - +91 73043 57388: Yes we will convert it to a string but first the numbers p and q are divided then their result is stored in string
01/07/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 73043 57388: I even used long double but still doesn't getting more than 5 digits
01/07/2020, 5:26 pm - Janvi Rathod: You will have to do the division process in small small steps
01/07/2020, 5:27 pm - Janvi Rathod: And store the number decimal by decimal by appending the string.
01/07/2020, 5:28 pm - Janvi Rathod: There was a similar problem on code chef
Where you had to find the factorial of numbers > 21 
Suppose you have to calculate 100!
01/07/2020, 5:28 pm - Janvi Rathod: You have to write a special algorithm for division
01/07/2020, 5:28 pm - Sanyog Sharma: correct
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Sanyog Sharma: simulate the division process
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Janvi Rathod: I have the solution for this.
You can read and then write the required algorithm for division.
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Janvi Rathod: Yess.
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Sanyog Sharma: and keep adding
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Arre sir ye kese karneka?
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Janvi Rathod: Vo explain karna mushkil hai

01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Code mujhe bhi bejhna
01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Janvi Rathod: Imagine you have to divide using pen and paper
01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Janvi Rathod: Usko algorithm me dalna hai
01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Janvi Rathod: Idhar hi bhej rha hu
01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Remainder waise sab karke

01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Ohh damn
01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Samjh gaya
01/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Samay Raina: use BigInteger
01/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Samay Raina: like how the computer internally does right?
01/07/2020, 5:34 pm - Janvi Rathod: https://blog.codechef.com/2009/07/02/tutorial-for-small-factorials/
01/07/2020, 5:35 pm - Janvi Rathod: See this.
This is algorithm for multiplying.
01/07/2020, 5:35 pm - Janvi Rathod: Read the full thing.
It will help you a lot while writing algorithm for division.
01/07/2020, 5:35 pm - Janvi Rathod: No.
Like a human does.
01/07/2020, 5:36 pm - Janvi Rathod: Won't work.
01/07/2020, 5:36 pm - Janvi Rathod: 100! Has 158 digits.
01/07/2020, 5:39 pm - +91 73043 57388: Got that
I used setprecision with cout
01/07/2020, 5:39 pm - +91 73043 57388: BUT Still getting WA
01/07/2020, 5:40 pm - Janvi Rathod: You tried writing the division algorithm?
01/07/2020, 5:41 pm - +91 73043 57388: Ya tried but not so good
01/07/2020, 5:42 pm - Janvi Rathod: Then need to make it efficient.
01/07/2020, 5:43 pm - Sanyog Sharma: int n;
        cin >> n;
        int p,q;
        cin >> p >> q;
        int sum = 0;
        int tmp = p%q;

        tmp=tmp*10;
        while(tmp < q)tmp*=10;
        sum+=tmp/q;
        tmp = tmp%q;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            tmp = tmp * 10;
            while(tmp < q)tmp*=10;

01/07/2020, 5:52 pm - Rupali Jain: Aare aise baat nahi hai.
01/07/2020, 5:56 pm - Rupali Jain: Python actually goes one step further, all intergers are automatically converted to bigints when they get larger than 32 bits.
```>>> f = 1
>>> for i in range(2, 101):
...     f *= i
...
>>> f

But, never mind, I'll look it up and experiment so that, understand.
06/07/2020, 8:16 pm - Janvi Rathod: I was looking for a shortcut, like if someone has done it, I would have just asked how, but I'll do it on my own only.

06/07/2020, 11:15 pm - Samay Raina: I had a question,is there any harm in putting semicolon at the end of every statement in MySQL?
06/07/2020, 11:17 pm - Samay Raina: or can some1 just tell me when are semi-colons reqd. in SQL,I am kinda confused with this as  I saw tutorials where they almost never use it
06/07/2020, 11:18 pm - +91 82916 21138: Actually semicolon is used to end a query.
06/07/2020, 11:23 pm - Samay Raina: yes got it now'

07/07/2020, 1:23 am - Samay Raina: can any1 explain what this means in SQL
07/07/2020, 1:23 am - Samay Raina: its a regex
07/07/2020, 1:24 am - Janvi Rathod: No no,
I'm talking about Django 
Class based SQL tables for backend
07/07/2020, 1:48 am - Manvi Jain: This type of regex probably means it should start with _aeiou._
07/07/2020, 1:51 am - Manvi Jain: And it should probably be ```^[aeiou]```. I am not too sure.

07/07/2020, 1:59 am - Samay Raina: There was a problem on hackerrank to select names of cities from a table with should not start or end with a vowel and this worked

07/07/2020, 9:20 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Yeah when the program doesn't output anything
07/07/2020, 9:21 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Idleness limit exceeded occurs when your program stays idle (waiting for user/interaction program) for long time.

I'm not sure why is it not WA instead of Idleness limit exceeded. My guess is that interaction program expects a newline and thus keeps on waiting for your program.

10/07/2020, 6:32 pm - Janvi Rathod: Don't jump around everything. 
I've tried and I've failed....

10/07/2020, 7:21 pm - Sanyog Sharma: What is HomeBrew ? Is this for Mac only?
10/07/2020, 7:21 pm - Rupali Jain: Not technially, no.
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Rupali Jain: It was developed as a package mangager for Mac.
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Sanyog Sharma: But what is HomeBrew?
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Rupali Jain: Similar to apt and apk.
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Vikram Nandal: Package manager like Linux has apt...
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Rupali Jain: Exactly.
10/07/2020, 7:23 pm - Rupali Jain: It is also availiable for linux.
10/07/2020, 7:24 pm - Rupali Jain: It has limited use, except in very rare situations.
One thing it does differently is it installs all software to the USER's partition instead of system.
10/07/2020, 7:24 pm - Rupali Jain: Means you don't have to be root to install software.
10/07/2020, 7:25 pm - Rupali Jain: You can "isolate" brew to one directory and it will not touch anything outside that directory.
10/07/2020, 7:25 pm - Vikram Nandal: Are u trying to install git?? That‚Äôs why asking for home brew? For example if I needed to install git on OS X u can use home brew as ur package manager. This will automatically install all the Xcode command line tools recquired for git to run on ur mac
10/07/2020, 7:26 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Yeah
10/07/2020, 7:26 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Oh acha
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Vikram Nandal: Thought so, I also did the same recently üòÖ. Anyway, instead of manually installing full Xcode and command line tools, this package manager will only install the needed libraries for vcs system like git to work on OS X
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Rupali Jain: I think you can just do ```git``` on the command line and it will propmpt for installation.
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Rupali Jain: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_macos
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Yeahh thats what i did
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Yeah
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Vikram Nandal: I don‚Äôt think that works in terminal on OSX
10/07/2020, 7:29 pm - Sanyog Sharma: not only git i did 'brew install git'
10/07/2020, 7:31 pm - Vikram Nandal: Did u first try installing homebrew, wait I‚Äôll share tutorials I followed... just a sec
10/07/2020, 7:31 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Yeah i installed HomeBrew first
10/07/2020, 7:31 pm - Sanyog Sharma: then through terminal i did brew install git
10/07/2020, 7:32 pm - Sanyog Sharma: but it seems ki when you install Xcode , git gets installed too
10/07/2020, 7:32 pm - Vikram Nandal: Oh then do u have Xcode installed and before that pls check software update section, command line tools installing happens from there...
10/07/2020, 7:32 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Yeah i have Xcode
10/07/2020, 7:33 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Software update section?
10/07/2020, 7:33 pm - Vikram Nandal: Nope it‚Äôs not needed to install Xcode just command line tools are necessary mostly but check software update section, they are installed from there
10/07/2020, 7:33 pm - Vikram Nandal: I mean where u get os updates
10/07/2020, 7:34 pm - Sanyog Sharma: It just shows Your mac is up to date
10/07/2020, 7:35 pm - Vikram Nandal: Try running git‚Äîversion command is it giving back any version or no ?? If not I think some installing issue.. I will find tutorial I used.
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Yeah it gives the version number
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - Sanyog Sharma: git is installed
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - Vikram Nandal: Then it‚Äôs installed
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - Sanyog Sharma: just wanted to know about Home Brew
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - Vikram Nandal: Oh üòÇ Ya oh I thought stuck with installing
10/07/2020, 7:37 pm - Sanyog Sharma: loll
10/07/2020, 7:37 pm - Rupali Jain: XCode has old packages sometimes.
Note that the latest git version is 2.27.0.
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Sanyog Sharma: I'll check
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Sanyog Sharma: just a sec
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Yup its 2.27.0
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Rupali Jain: Great!
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Vikram Nandal: Homebrew is just a command line package manager like Kartik and I said what we have in in Linux, like apt, debians dpkg etc
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Thanks @918080142783 and @919768167131 !
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Yeah abhi i got to know
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Vikram Nandal: Anytime üòÖ
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Thanks
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Rupali Jain: No problem.
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Rupali Jain: Just a side note, dpkg is just a package installer, it will not download dependencies.
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Rupali Jain: apt uses dpkg internally.
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Sanyog Sharma: It went over my head lol
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya ya.. it‚Äôs installer sorry
10/07/2020, 7:42 pm - Vikram Nandal: But ig installers can be considered a part of package manger.. right??
10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Rupali Jain: Basically if you do ``apt install git``` then it will automatically download and install git, curl and all the other dependencies.
But for dpkg, you have to manually download git.deb, curl.deb, etc. and install them one by one in the correct order.
10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Rupali Jain: Yes, definately. Package installers are the most important part of a package manager.
10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Ohhh

18/07/2020, 10:41 am - +91 82916 21138: The following order of learning would make sense.

Core Java - it is important to start with core Java for understanding the fundamental in Java programming.

Servlets - JSP and Servlet are important to understand the web technologies

Java EE

Spring Framework

Hibernate Framework



Java is a very vast language and used in various forms like Socket programming, Web Application development, Portal designing, Android applications, Purely Backend developments using Webservices and lot more. So first decide what you want to learn.

Learn accordingly.

1. Core Java : Most Important . Learn all the concepts don‚Äôt miss a single one. Its the heart and soul of Java

2. JSP and Servlet : These are basics of Web application development. Earlier all the applications were made using these technology but now they are just a part of Web development.

3. JDBC : You should be familiar with this concepts . Your daily life belongs to this only. Learn basics of SQL language also for CRUD operation.

4.Spring: The most useful framework which is used for various applications .

5.Hibernate: Its useful for DB interaction at the highest speed.

You can follow the 12345 all for a Spring web application development.

You can follow 1235 for Hibernate developer.

You can learn only 1 for Socket programming.

If you want to be a Android developer then learn only 1 and then proceed to android studio.

Except this you can learn JSF and Webservices for better knowledge and work
18/07/2020, 10:41 am - +91 82916 21138: Learning path for java developer
18/07/2020, 10:52 am - Mudit Verma: Are 2 to 5 used a lot in the industry?
18/07/2020, 10:53 am - Mudit Verma: Yeah but don't say no if they aren't offering a stiped.
18/07/2020, 10:53 am - Mudit Verma: The experience will really help you!
18/07/2020, 10:55 am - +91 82916 21138: Yes I have heard in industries java spring and hibernate  is  used a lot I mean 2 to 5 cause it's old technology so slowly things are changing but still java is used in enterprise level applications .

19/07/2020, 10:26 am - +91 82916 21138: I found some good question and answer
19/07/2020, 10:26 am - +91 82916 21138: Prashasti Agarwal:
I am graduating this year and I have job offer of 3-4 LPA. Should I focus on preparing for GATE or for DSA and CP?

Satbir Singh:
It's your wish. Remember GATE will give one chance per year to prove your worth whereas if you do CP and you're prepared you can get many chance to attend various interviews.

Anurag Goel:
After doing GATE, you will be doing M.Tech and again focussing on coding skills, Cp and DSA  for placement season after 2 years. 

So it would be better if you switch your 3-4 lpa to 8-10+ lpa in product based company by learning those coding skills self. 
I've been exactly at the same position as you are today and can feel the dilemma but if job is the end goal, better to grind yourself now with DSA coding skills along with existing job.

19/07/2020, 12:22 pm - Mudit Verma: I'm sad that none of my repos had even a single star in Feb, so they were not included...
19/07/2020, 12:22 pm - Samay Raina: But you have the arctic vault

19/07/2020, 12:44 pm - Mudit Verma: And how did GitHub come to know?
19/07/2020, 12:44 pm - Samay Raina: Some algorithm ig

19/07/2020, 12:55 pm - Janvi Rathod: Do you know about the Artic Seed Vault?
It's to protect the original seeds, because in these days, hybrid seeds ke vajha se original seeds are vanishing.

This code thing, I feel GitHub is just doing for publicity. 
Maybe, just a marketing stunt.
19/07/2020, 12:55 pm - Samay Raina: Lol

19/07/2020, 2:13 pm - Anjali Kapoor: App ID is which is Imp just look that after re adding the app app ID is changed
19/07/2020, 2:13 pm - Mudit Verma: So you mean that a new project need not be created?
19/07/2020, 2:14 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Yes if app id is changed that u don't need to do make new project
19/07/2020, 2:14 pm - Samay Raina: Ok then
19/07/2020, 2:15 pm - Samay Raina: Will have connect it againüòì

19/07/2020, 2:16 pm - Samay Raina: Srsly needed
19/07/2020, 2:16 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Making a new project is the best option but this will be a lot of work
19/07/2020, 2:16 pm - Mudit Verma: Do this till then
19/07/2020, 2:17 pm - Samay Raina: If I make a new project then code will still be the same right?
19/07/2020, 2:17 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Only thing which important is app ID and API key
19/07/2020, 2:17 pm - Samay Raina: Only I will have to set up the connection again?
19/07/2020, 2:18 pm - Mudit Verma: Yeah and migrate app data in Firebase (idk how it's done though)

19/07/2020, 2:58 pm - Mudit Verma: Hey this is nice, @918291679151!

My opinions:
- In mobile view, get the number pad above the operator pad
- Make the operators visible in the box.
- The press handling is a little difficult. (Idk how you can improve that...)

- Add CSS transitions (literally 1 line of CSS)
- Adjust the padding so that there are no scrollbars (at least on Desktop)
- It is very bad practice for UI to shift. Make your buttons not shift on hover.

This happens when you've already created a table in the database which has a few entries and now you try to add a new column
So what django is saying is that since the field you've given is non-nullable, django can't just give null value to it, and so, you'll have to assign a default value to all the existing entries in the table
20/07/2020, 10:33 am - Janvi Rathod: Yes correct. 
I just wanted to change.
Needed to add 2 columns

22/07/2020, 5:22 pm - Rupali Jain: ```int largestPrimeFactor(int n){
    if(n <= 3)
        return n;
    
    int f = 1;
    while(n > 1){
        f++;
        while(n % f == 0)
            n /= f;
    }
    
    return f;
}```
22/07/2020, 5:23 pm - Rupali Jain: You have to add logic to handle 0 and negative numbers.
22/07/2020, 5:26 pm - Sanyog Sharma: ```
vector<int> divs;
int check(int x) {
    if(x <= 1) return -1;
    
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= x ; ++i) {
        if(x%i == 0) {
           divs.push_back(i);
           while(x % i == 0) {
               x = x / i;
           }
        }
    }
    
    if(divs.empty())divs.push_back(x);
    
    return divs.back();
}```
22/07/2020, 5:26 pm - Sanyog Sharma: try this
22/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Rupali Jain: 1. Java
2. No need for a vector
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Sanyog Sharma: this will TLE if n is prime. But I think there isn't any time constraint on Udemy, so this will also work
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Rupali Jain: Why?
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Lets say N is 10^9 + 7
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Rupali Jain: Use n = 5
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Sanyog Sharma: your loop will run 10^9 + 7 times
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Sanyog Sharma: ?
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Rupali Jain: Easier.
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Rupali Jain: And no.
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Rupali Jain: Wait, is 10e9 + 7 prime?
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Yes it will
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Sanyog Sharma: yeah
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Manvi Jain: Yes.
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Rupali Jain: Ah, then yes.
22/07/2020, 5:32 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Here I have optimized it. Consider any number N, if its not prime then it'll definitely have a factor <= sqrt(N)
22/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Sanyog Sharma: so Time Complexity is O(sqrt(n))
22/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Rupali Jain: I was aiming for simplicity, but OK.
22/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Yeah both solutions should work

        if(x % i == 0) {
           f = i;

Mera ek query tha
Humlog json mei multiple objects ko array ke form mei store karte hai right

So mujhe har object ko retrive karke usko HTML pe div mei styling karna hai toh kaise karengay?
07/08/2020, 2:10 pm - Rupali Jain: Example?
07/08/2020, 2:10 pm - +91 73043 57388: Job listing
07/08/2020, 2:11 pm - +91 73043 57388: Now i have multiple jobs 

And data regarding each job has to be retrieved from JSON file and styled in different divs
07/08/2020, 2:12 pm - +91 70394 60876: Thanks man
07/08/2020, 2:14 pm - Rupali Jain: So write a function to take the json data and create the required markup.
07/08/2020, 2:14 pm - Mudit Verma: Have a for loop in the templating syntax that you're using and then add the necessary data in that
07/08/2020, 2:15 pm - Rupali Jain: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è WHY?

The code is a little complex, but you should get the idea.

https://github.com/tusharnankani/Swadeshi/blob/master/frontend/farmer/script.js#L39-L56
07/08/2020, 2:18 pm - +91 73043 57388: So you have retrieved data from JSON?
07/08/2020, 2:19 pm - Rupali Jain: @917304357388 No, that is server side rendering.
07/08/2020, 2:19 pm - Rupali Jain: The data is retrieved directly from the database.
07/08/2020, 2:20 pm - Mudit Verma: Yeah
07/08/2020, 2:20 pm - Mudit Verma: But it is a JSON object that has been returned from the DB
07/08/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 73043 57388: Your are dynamically creating a HTML element?

Actually I was thinking about that exactly

Is it possible to dynamically create DIV element for each JSON object retrieved?
07/08/2020, 2:21 pm - Rupali Jain: YES.
07/08/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 73043 57388: Thanks I will try

10/08/2020, 11:57 am - Janvi Rathod: How do I do that?
10/08/2020, 11:58 am - Rupali Jain: Find your PC's (local) IP address.
10/08/2020, 11:58 am - Rupali Jain: Then go to that ip address + port number.
10/08/2020, 11:58 am - Anjali Kapoor: If you are on wifi enable port forwarding
10/08/2020, 11:58 am - Anjali Kapoor: And do this

10/08/2020, 12:31 pm - +91 89764 07509: yes this step is correct but @918451904417 you will also have to add that ipaddress in allowed hosts in settings.py
10/08/2020, 12:32 pm - +91 89764 07509: and then in terminal give python manage.py (ip addr):8000

11/08/2020, 8:21 pm - Mudit Verma: Google Foobar is rumoured to be a recruitment strategy of the past. It's still present as a challenge, but I've read that they've stopped recruiting through that.
11/08/2020, 8:23 pm - Samay Raina: Oh
11/08/2020, 8:23 pm - Samay Raina: Maybe because its very popular and easy to learn
11/08/2020, 8:26 pm - +91 98337 26449: It still puts you in their radar. Or else they would've completely canned it.
11/08/2020, 8:26 pm - Mudit Verma: Yeah maybe.
11/08/2020, 8:56 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Google is shifting from java because it have some licensing issues
11/08/2020, 8:57 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah I heard this too
11/08/2020, 8:58 pm - Mudit Verma: It was a stupid move by Oracle imo. They're killing off Java...
11/08/2020, 8:59 pm - Anjali Kapoor: And Flutter can never replace native...it is true google is try to push kotlin through it.
11/08/2020, 9:02 pm - Samay Raina: Yes
11/08/2020, 9:03 pm - Samay Raina: But the fuchsia OS will be totally flutter based right!?
11/08/2020, 9:08 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Will it be able to take over most popular OS?
11/08/2020, 9:10 pm - +91 82916 21138: ü§î interesting question tbh maybe I heard they are filling all gaps of android and making it
11/08/2020, 9:12 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I have already told this but think of replacing millions of android devices
11/08/2020, 9:20 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah  it will be gradual process but still üòÖ maybe fuchsia becomes new update of android and from there on things change or something like that ü§î
11/08/2020, 9:20 pm - +91 82916 21138: Like android has already started removing some stuff
11/08/2020, 9:21 pm - Anjali Kapoor: This can never happen...
11/08/2020, 9:21 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah ik
11/08/2020, 9:22 pm - +91 82916 21138: I mean android is changing although so maybe idk who knows the future üòÖ
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Samay Raina: Just don't want to be with an obsolete skill thats itüòÖüòÇ
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Samay Raina: I mean native android dev
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Samay Raina: What if it becomes obsolete at the end of 4 years
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Changing a os means bye bye to your data
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Samay Raina: Yes
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Nhi hoga bhai
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Samay Raina: üôèüôè
11/08/2020, 9:24 pm - +91 82916 21138: Haa
11/08/2020, 9:24 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Android 4.4 bhi use kar rahe hai log üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/08/2020, 9:24 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah ik but I mean  they will declare last version of android and then declare after this it will be Fuchsian
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - Anjali Kapoor: No not gonna happen
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 82916 21138: Like and Android's last version might look similar to Fuchsian maybe  kind of like that so smooth switch ü§î
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Leaving support for millions of devices is not simple and thing they can do as a company
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 82916 21138: True
11/08/2020, 9:26 pm - +91 82916 21138: ü§î yeah true thing but what I read is that they are planning to make something which all iot device etc can use etc so don't know
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Rupali Jain: Kaha se aate aise idea?
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Rupali Jain: Most definately not.
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Rupali Jain: You can change you OS without loosing your data.
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Rupali Jain: As long as it is implemented properly.
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Anjali Kapoor: If I flash a custom rom for it's recommended for a clean flash
11/08/2020, 9:28 pm - Rupali Jain: **recommended**
11/08/2020, 9:29 pm - Rupali Jain: And that is because they don't know what your previous OS was.
11/08/2020, 9:29 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Yaa i tried not to and it gave me errors while boot so i did a clean flash
11/08/2020, 9:29 pm - Anjali Kapoor: 9 to 10 and the stock was released on 9
11/08/2020, 9:30 pm - Rupali Jain: If you know which OS the phone is running, and you have can push (signed) OTA updates, you can do almost anything.
11/08/2020, 9:30 pm - Rupali Jain: Again, this is a custom rom.
11/08/2020, 9:30 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Don't you think fuchsia will have totally different file structure and permissions?
11/08/2020, 9:31 pm - +91 82916 21138: ü§î maybe true
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Samay Raina: Yes can be
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Rupali Jain: Even if they do, it is trivial to copy over all data from the old locations to the new one.
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Anjali Kapoor: App data?
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Samay Raina: Fuchsia won't be Linux based right?
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Rupali Jain: Now app data, I agree, will be quite difficult to port.
11/08/2020, 9:33 pm - Anjali Kapoor: And will OEMs will do itüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/08/2020, 9:33 pm - Rupali Jain: But most apps backup to the cloud anyways, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/08/2020, 9:33 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I still don't have officially Android 10ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Samay Raina: You rooted your phone for android 10!?

11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Samay Raina: Now?
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Anjali Kapoor: You can't support only *some* apps
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - +91 82916 21138: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£XDA forum ?
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Rupali Jain: Even if they don't save to cloud, you can usually export settings to a file.
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Service centerüòÇ
11/08/2020, 9:35 pm - Samay Raina: But you can still get the former OS right
11/08/2020, 9:35 pm - Samay Raina: I mean its not a permanent brick
11/08/2020, 9:35 pm - +91 82916 21138: ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/08/2020, 9:35 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Fastboot was crashing

11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Yup with crashed fastboot
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Rupali Jain: I did it for mine.
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Samay Raina: F
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I was unable to access twrp and fastboot was crashing
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Samay Raina: I would like to flash a custom ROM in my purana phoneüòÇ
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Rupali Jain: Yes, even then.
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Samay Raina: It runs on Android 6
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Anjali Kapoor: How?? I tried anything which was available on XDA
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Samay Raina: How can I do it @917738557601
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Anjali Kapoor: XDAüòÇ
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Samay Raina: How did you unlock the bootloader,m
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Rupali Jain: It is like flashing the phone in the factory.
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Some have a simple one line command
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Samay Raina: Nexus

11/08/2020, 9:42 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I don't know how they fixed but I'm happy they fixed itüòÇ
11/08/2020, 9:43 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Whenever i type any command on fastboot it restarts the device
11/08/2020, 9:43 pm - +91 99693 94098: Which device?
11/08/2020, 9:43 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Ek ek error screen tha which only said press power button to restart
11/08/2020, 9:44 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Asus zenfone max pro m2üòÇüòÇ

11/08/2020, 9:46 pm - +91 99693 94098: Did you try overwriting the recovery partition?
11/08/2020, 9:46 pm - +91 82916 21138: I had put another os in my old phone using XDA twrp use kiya usse phele phone unlock Kiya and Kiya mast clear Kiya etc
11/08/2020, 9:46 pm - Samay Raina: Your juna tab?
11/08/2020, 9:47 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yes old tab and my friends phone also I did the same
11/08/2020, 9:47 pm - Samay Raina: Lol
11/08/2020, 9:47 pm - Anjali Kapoor: So the mistake i did was that twrp didn't supported restore for android 10 and without knowing this is tried to restore app data
11/08/2020, 9:48 pm - Samay Raina: So you can't get android 10 in anyway?
11/08/2020, 9:48 pm - +91 82916 21138: I had put resurrection remix
11/08/2020, 9:48 pm - +91 82916 21138: Haa twrp plays tweaks like that
11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - Anjali Kapoor: You can why not?
11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - Samay Raina: But why you couldn't? didn't get it?
11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - +91 99693 94098: Big F. Should've used a compatible twrp. If you could overwrite the recovery with a compatible version, you could've fixed the issue
11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - Samay Raina: Did you lose all app data?
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - +91 99693 94098: Android 10 has scoped storage so you can't directly shift data
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - Samay Raina: Oh
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Again you couldn't execute any command in fastboot... this was first thing that i tried
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - Samay Raina: I want to try to go from Android 6 to Android 10 on my old phone,will definitely tryüòÇ

11/08/2020, 9:53 pm - Rupali Jain: Basically driver files.
11/08/2020, 9:53 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Fastboot roms?
11/08/2020, 9:55 pm - Anjali Kapoor: <Media omitted>
11/08/2020, 9:55 pm - +91 99693 94098: Fastboot flashable ROMs. As I said I'm not sure of zenfone but devices like samsung and miui have Odin and miui flash tool
11/08/2020, 9:56 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I tried the official asus flash toolkit but it required to run in fastboot

11/08/2020, 9:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: It's a bit different than a simple fastboot command but it's fine

11/08/2020, 10:08 pm - Rupali Jain: Are you sure?
11/08/2020, 10:08 pm - Rupali Jain: A 1TB SSD is *not* cheap.
11/08/2020, 10:10 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Yeah
11/08/2020, 10:11 pm - Manvi Jain: 1TB SATA is 1 TB SSD?
11/08/2020, 10:12 pm - Manvi Jain: According to what I have read, for gaming laptops, 512 SSD and 4 GB graphic card would work the best.
11/08/2020, 10:12 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Wait I am confused. What I have seen mostly are the ones with 1TB hddand 256 GB SSD.

This one laptop says 1TB SATA
11/08/2020, 10:12 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Sata is ssd?
11/08/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 77180 82108: Gaming laptops are not worth the money

11/08/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 88798 05171: No
11/08/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 77180 82108: SATA is an interface

Alright, so it's a django based website
So I need the storage to upload images from the admin panel and display it to the users 
So I was thinking whether it'll be better if I had an indian based storage since the users are from india
13/08/2020, 12:03 pm - Rupali Jain: *THESE* details.
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Rupali Jain: So why is the website hosted in the US?
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Mudit Verma: Won't the AWS CDN handle that?
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Janvi Rathod: Django ü§©
My heart goes 
La La La La La
La La La La
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Mudit Verma: üòÇ
13/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Rupali Jain: A cdn is a Content *Delivery* Network.
13/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Mudit Verma: Yeah, but it can cache stuff, so it won't have to keep fetching stuff from the US, right?

13/08/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 75078 05454: üòÇ it's difficult to make that library work with gcc. You have to get a ported version and then link the library while compiling. Even then the things that can be drawn with that library make you feel like you have time travelled to 2009 üòÇ
13/08/2020, 2:27 pm - Samay Raina: I really dk why such stuff is being taught to us, instead theu could teach Graphics in Python/Java
13/08/2020, 2:28 pm - Samay Raina: C/C++ is used for system programming
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Rupali Jain: Do you know how Graphics are drawn in Python/Java?
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Rupali Jain: It ultimately falls back to C/C++
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Samay Raina: Would like to üòõ
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Janvi Rathod: By converting in C/C++
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Janvi Rathod: Hai na?
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Samay Raina: But thats dead imo
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Samay Raina: Why would we do that work? libraries hai na Java/Python mai
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Janvi Rathod: Nah bro
Even paint and all built using C/C++
I heard
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Janvi Rathod: How do you think Python Was built ?
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Samay Raina: Ha but do we really have to rebuild the wheelü§î
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Samay Raina: Yes bro C/C++ are base of all languages I understand
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Rupali Jain: No, but you should understand how the wheel works.
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Janvi Rathod: It's for those who want it get into Graphics 
Suppose Game Dev me bhi
If you see the Game Engines are also built using C+++
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Samay Raina: True but....turbo C++ use karna zaroori hai uske liyeüòÇ
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - +91 75078 05454: we should be learning 3d graphics using opengl or something
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Janvi Rathod: C++
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Rupali Jain: That I agree with.
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Samay Raina: C#
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Samay Raina: Yeah
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Rupali Jain: But after basic graphics.
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Samay Raina: graphics.h is obsolete right?
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Janvi Rathod: We use C# while building games
But
The actual Engine 
Unity is built using C++

13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - Anjali Kapoor: @918080142783 if they are doing graphics cpp and their libraries are old then how morden languages are using it?
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Like are they modifying it or something else?
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Rupali Jain: Again, graphics.h is depricated because modern processors support SIMD.
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Samay Raina: Or calling its methods internally
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Samay Raina: Oh
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Rupali Jain: SIMD is Single Instruction, Multiple Data.
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Rupali Jain: So if you want to add/multiply 4 sets of numbers then you can do it in 1 operation.
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Anjali Kapoor: So the languages are using this and we are learning graphics.h?ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Samay Raina: F

13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Haa but I just asking this
13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - Rupali Jain: It is easier to understand SIMD once you know what the hell you are actually doing with the data.
13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - Samay Raina: Ooh
13/08/2020, 2:37 pm - Anjali Kapoor: But sometimes you can skip bicycleüòÅ

15/08/2020, 11:07 pm - Sanyog Sharma: Total no of students in Tsec in 1 year=
120 CS + 120 IT + 60 Extc + 60 Biomedical + 60 BioTech + 60 Chemical = 480
.¬∞.Total number of students in all 4 years=480*4=1920(minimum no of students) 
Tution fees per sem = 129545
Consider in worst case 50% students as OBC/EBC
No of obc/ebc students=960
.¬∞.Rem students=960
Total revenue (in form of tution fees) by obc/ebc students= 960*129545*0.5 =62181600
Total revenue (in form of tution fees) by regular students= 960*129545=124,363,200
Total tution fees gained per year = 186,544,800
Total college development feea gained per year = 1920*12955 = 24,873,600

Total income of college per year(worst case) = 186544800+24873600 = 211,418,400 = 21.14Cr

Now with such an amount of income considering the fees to be given to teachers,other staffs,electricity bill and cost of devices,etc..still there must be a decent amount of money left with the authority, where that goes!!!!!!

24/08/2020, 3:12 pm - Mudit Verma: My opinion:

Do everything yourself, college is mostly useless.

Do DBMS and DSA yourself, they are really important.
DSA: Please code things out yourself. Try to code out all the DS and their types yourself. DSA Sorting: GFG has short vids on all sorts on YT. They are your bible.

Imp vid: SQL and ER diags: https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY

Do a small crash course on core Java. It's moderately important. Please don't go for any long course.

PCE is just mugging up.

What is comp. prog. fundas!? We didn't have that. Idr what we had in place of that lol
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - Samay Raina: DSA should we learn only in C or other languages as well?
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - Mudit Verma: My opinion: Do everything from YT. Don't take any courses, even if they are free.
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - Mudit Verma: C for now.

24/08/2020, 3:20 pm - Samay Raina: thats actually great
24/08/2020, 3:21 pm - Mudit Verma: My opinion:

DSA: PLEASE code things yourself. If you want to refer to a book, not required of you've paid attention in class, 'DS and algo in C'.

DBMS: Do the SQL vid that I shared. I would not recommend a book. Use Techmax.

24/08/2020, 3:24 pm - Rupali Jain: Also, please download, install and acutally USE a Database.
24/08/2020, 3:24 pm - Rupali Jain: MariaDB/MySQL for SQL, and MongoDB/Redis for NoSQL.
24/08/2020, 3:25 pm - Rupali Jain: Play around with the command line, and understand the difference between SQL and NoSQl.
24/08/2020, 3:25 pm - Mudit Verma: Yes yes
24/08/2020, 3:25 pm - Rupali Jain: Also, ```mariadb``` and ```mariadbd``` are VERY different.

26/08/2020, 12:03 pm - +91 86559 19035: That's messed up
26/08/2020, 12:03 pm - Rupali Jain: You know, that I sort of agree with.
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Samay Raina: @918828470904  cursed?
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Samay Raina: Actually
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Samay Raina: Bcoz tags yaad kaise hongeüòÖ
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Rupali Jain: VSCode has too much hand-holding.
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I'm writing java in notepad++üòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Samay Raina: But hamesha using notepad is stupidity
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Samay Raina: Fir bhi ok
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I'm missing auto bracket closingüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Rupali Jain: But I feel they should at least allow syntax hlighting, like vim or emacs or even notepad++.
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Samay Raina: True lol
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - +91 84335 18102: true that
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Samay Raina: Or sublime
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Samay Raina: text
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Rupali Jain: No, not even sublime text.
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - +91 97694 89970: Hmm yes u r ryt. They gave the same reason that in exam we have to write everything so using notepad will help us to remember tags. But not everytime ya. I miss the boiler plate :/
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Rupali Jain: Again, too much autocomplete.
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Samay Raina: Hehe
26/08/2020, 12:06 pm - Vikram Nandal: Me too but I told sir ki on Mac no  good editor so he allowed VS Code üòÇ

26/08/2020, 12:06 pm - Vikram Nandal: I know but dint want to use..
26/08/2020, 12:06 pm - Rupali Jain: Which is actually a half decent code editior.
26/08/2020, 12:06 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya..
26/08/2020, 12:07 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Unko kya he pata chalega
26/08/2020, 12:07 pm - Rupali Jain: I still prefer notepad++ for speed, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
26/08/2020, 12:07 pm - Samay Raina: ?
26/08/2020, 12:07 pm - Vikram Nandal: Also syntax highlighting is good sometimes
26/08/2020, 12:07 pm - +91 84335 18102: aree he asks everyone to present their screens
26/08/2020, 12:07 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ha
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Samay Raina: F
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Rupali Jain: I personally don't use VSCode.
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Arre ki mac have edittext
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Samay Raina: Why tho
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Rupali Jain: Use vim.
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Textedit
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Rupali Jain: As I said, speed.
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Samay Raina: Speed?
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Rupali Jain: Notepad++ opens in like 300 ms.
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Anjali Kapoor: R u talking about command line vim?
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Rupali Jain: Yes.
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Samay Raina: <Media omitted>
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Rupali Jain: It's not that bad.
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Vikram Nandal: Haah I know but few teachers use Mac... still they don‚Äôt know üòÇüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Vikram Nandal: That‚Äôs the irony
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Anjali Kapoor: üòÇüòÇ they would go in comma
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Samay Raina: Mac is Amir log things bro
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Rupali Jain: Setup a hackintosh.
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Samay Raina: Ab yeh kya hai!?
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Vikram Nandal: I started on that only
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Vikram Nandal: Google
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Rupali Jain: But that might get harder with Apple Silicone.
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya true üòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Bhai support hardware toh hoüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Samay Raina: Windows zindabad
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Vikram Nandal: Arm architecture..
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Samay Raina: Windows ‚ù§Ô∏è
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Rupali Jain: Virtualbox.
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Samay Raina: Docker?
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I would better use windowsüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Or Linux
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Samay Raina: Hypervisor?
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Vikram Nandal: This is kinda useless until have a good specked laptop u can‚Äôt really run Xcode simulator completely I tried a lot..
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Rupali Jain: But I am skeptical about long term feasibility.
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Rupali Jain: Noooooo ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Vikram Nandal: So last resort hackintosh... though driver support is pathetic üòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Rupali Jain: You have completely missed the point.
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Yes as Microsoft is also pushing arm now
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - Vikram Nandal: Nope I guess they might just have it I was watching WWDC 2020 Rosetta 2 seems promising
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - Rupali Jain: Pushing arm is not the issue.
(Arm actually has better performance for lower price)
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - Vikram Nandal: They can‚Äôt make it happen for that u need control over hardware as well
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - Vikram Nandal: They failed once remember snapdragon 835 laptop
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 88284 70904: Mai sublime mai likha kuch bola nahi lolüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 86559 19035: And lower thermals
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Vikram Nandal: Windows ka some hp or Lenovo built in 2018 ig
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Anjali Kapoor: They are partnering with Qualcomm for chipset and supporting them
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - +91 86559 19035: Doesn't mean always
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Anjali Kapoor: +1
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Rupali Jain: The only reason big companies (Adobe/Autodesk) write hight performance software for Macs is because it is 99% similiar to Windows.
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Rupali Jain: So the extra effort is justified.
26/08/2020, 12:14 pm - Rupali Jain: (And almost negligible)
26/08/2020, 12:14 pm - Anjali Kapoor: After foldable from Microsoft i think they will do it
26/08/2020, 12:14 pm - Vikram Nandal: I know I read that now issue is they are different companies after all so how things work out is interesting also interesting is to see what amd and intel have in stock...
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - Rupali Jain: But if Windows and Mac instruction sets diverge, then most software will either stop supporting mac, or will use the automatice translation tools and take a huge performance hit.
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - +91 86559 19035: Amd is beating intel with ryzen for now in most places at lower costs
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Yes because intel n amd will suffer the most
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - Vikram Nandal: True agreed but I know if someone in the industry can make such big changes though foolish and work for them in their favour it‚Äôs got to be Apple...
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Rupali Jain: Not every time.
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Anjali Kapoor: True but will developer take enough efforts?
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - +91 86559 19035: They have given transition period for now and pro stuff stays on intel for now
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - +91 86559 19035: So we have to see what happens
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Rupali Jain: Adobe does NOT support the latest Mac Pro or the ludicrously expensive "Pro display".
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya that‚Äôs the catch Mac app support in App Store isn‚Äôt gr8 anyway, with arm chips Apple can bring mobile developers as in iPad OS and iOS developers to develop as well
26/08/2020, 12:17 pm - Rupali Jain: Yes, but that will be throwing away like 35+ YEARS of desktop developers.
26/08/2020, 12:17 pm - Rupali Jain: Imagine the knowledge and experience.
26/08/2020, 12:18 pm - Vikram Nandal: Yes üòÇüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:18 pm - +91 86559 19035: Not exactly
26/08/2020, 12:18 pm - Vikram Nandal: I agree but I feel they can pull this one off...
26/08/2020, 12:19 pm - Vikram Nandal: Plus they aren‚Äôt throwing anything to trash Rosetta 2 is helping not arm optimised apps to run at least
26/08/2020, 12:19 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Do u know how irritating it is to develop a UI for different screen sizeü•∫
26/08/2020, 12:20 pm - Rupali Jain: Forget UI, do you know how irritating it is to optimize for a different INSTRUCTION SET?
26/08/2020, 12:20 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ig they will Microsoft already had office ready on WWDC 2020 announced day to run on Mac so... Also it‚Äôs Apple a trillion dollar market cap company they can make it happen...
26/08/2020, 12:20 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Never did thatüòÇüòÖ
26/08/2020, 12:21 pm - Anjali Kapoor: It will take a loooonng time
26/08/2020, 12:21 pm - Rupali Jain: Even today, most server software has two versions: Windows (semi-supported) and Linux.
26/08/2020, 12:21 pm - Vikram Nandal: That‚Äôs the catch, since Apple has selected number of products which often use same screen sizes say like se 2020 which is iPhone 6 ka screen only so it‚Äôs much easier for them...
26/08/2020, 12:22 pm - Rupali Jain: MariaDB straight up has this warning: If you compile this on Mac, then anything that happens is your problem.
26/08/2020, 12:22 pm - Vikram Nandal: They themselves mention 2 yrs transition time.. let‚Äôs see üòÇüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:23 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya Agreed
26/08/2020, 12:23 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Who will install mac for serverüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:23 pm - Rupali Jain: No, they mean even for development.
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Ohh
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Vikram Nandal: Let‚Äôs see what pans out for the future of intel and amd specially cause that‚Äôs most interesting to me if this plan succeeds.... They won‚Äôt go without a fight it‚Äôs sure...
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Rupali Jain: Oh they are not going anywhere.
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Samay Raina: one question:
why are most servers linux based?
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Apple n EpicüòÇüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Rupali Jain: Even if all consumer products switch to arm, legacy servers will still need maintainence.
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Samay Raina: @918080142783
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Anjali Kapoor: I think Epic will win
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - Rupali Jain: And don't forget mainframes.
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - Vikram Nandal: I know but they might have to market their product differently or themselves make arm chips if Apple and Microsoft can pull arm transition off
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - Vikram Nandal: Open source so lot of libraries available
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - Vikram Nandal: Natively
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - Rupali Jain: Two reasons:
- No licensing issues
- Raw performance.
26/08/2020, 12:26 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya also performance...
26/08/2020, 12:26 pm - Rupali Jain: And the performance part comes from being open source.
26/08/2020, 12:27 pm - Rupali Jain: So if you don't want a network driver (for whatever reason), simply delete the code for networking and suddenly you have the best performing kernal for your application.
26/08/2020, 12:27 pm - Samay Raina: ok yeah open source
26/08/2020, 12:27 pm - Samay Raina: quick bug fuxes
26/08/2020, 12:29 pm - Rupali Jain: And you can fix a bug yourself if needed.
26/08/2020, 12:29 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya this is the main reason lot of restrictions in Windows especially OSX for this üòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:29 pm - Samay Raina: ha
26/08/2020, 12:30 pm - Rupali Jain: Oh yes.
26/08/2020, 12:30 pm - Rupali Jain: The source code of Windows has been leaked once or twice but I don't think anyone was able to compile it.
26/08/2020, 12:30 pm - Samay Raina: wow
26/08/2020, 12:31 pm - Vikram Nandal: Wow when??
26/08/2020, 12:31 pm - Rupali Jain: I don't remember exactly, but not too long ago.
26/08/2020, 12:31 pm - Vikram Nandal: Ya I remember even Xbox source code was leaked
26/08/2020, 12:33 pm - Samay Raina: compile it?why not?
26/08/2020, 12:37 pm - Anjali Kapoor: Ig whole source codes were never leaked
26/08/2020, 12:41 pm - Rupali Jain: Maybe ~3 years?
26/08/2020, 12:41 pm - Rupali Jain: Who is in C1?
26/08/2020, 12:42 pm - Rupali Jain: You have a Maths lecture with Indrajit Sir at 1pm?

26/08/2020, 5:01 pm - Janvi Rathod: Sort of...
26/08/2020, 5:03 pm - +91 98337 47258: She's one of the best teachers actually
She can be a little strict, especially in physical lecs but ya she's good
26/08/2020, 5:03 pm - Janvi Rathod: Thanks
I too felt she's the best.
26/08/2020, 5:04 pm - +91 98337 47258: She's been very fast in online lecs but in physical lecs you wouldn't wanna miss her lecs
26/08/2020, 5:04 pm - Janvi Rathod: Someone else was saying some dialogue üòÖüòÇ
And I ended up speaking something at the same time
And maam ko laga maine bola üòÖ
26/08/2020, 5:04 pm - +91 98337 47258: Dw, she's chill
26/08/2020, 5:05 pm - Janvi Rathod: So now I'm her target üòÖüòÇ
26/08/2020, 5:05 pm - Janvi Rathod: Alright thanks.

26/08/2020, 5:06 pm - Janvi Rathod: No
26/08/2020, 5:06 pm - Janvi Rathod: I'm in SE
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 98337 47258: And if you see SSS ma'am, just hide your face and run away
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Janvi Rathod: Who is SSS?
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Rupali Jain: > Anagha maam

What do you mean by best teacher?
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Rupali Jain: In all her lectures, all she has done is read from the ppt.
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 98337 47258: We had her in SE too
But sem 4, i don't remember if sem 3
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Janvi Rathod: ??
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Rupali Jain: Like literally read out the slide line by line.
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - Janvi Rathod: Reminds me of Primary school teachers üòÖ
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 98337 47258: Just a teacher most of the students avoid
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 98337 47258: And still do ig
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - Rupali Jain: And she also gave use some gems like:
"When you switch on the voltage of the current ..."
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - Samay Raina: She forced some ppl to switch their web cams on
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - Samay Raina: That was boss moment üòÇ
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - +91 98337 47258: Yaa
She did here too
But she mentioned it was all new for her and it would make her comfortable seeing faces
So that's understandable
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - Rupali Jain: Also, electron energy gets converted to visual energy.
26/08/2020, 5:10 pm - Samay Raina: Yeah thats cool actually
26/08/2020, 5:11 pm - +91 98337 47258: We have her too but I just log in and move away
26/08/2020, 5:15 pm - Janvi Rathod: Full form?
26/08/2020, 5:16 pm - +91 98337 47258: For SSS?
26/08/2020, 5:16 pm - Janvi Rathod: Yes
26/08/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 98337 47258: Sonal ma'am ig ,not so sure

I just called her SSS
26/08/2020, 5:17 pm - Rupali Jain: Sonal Shroff?
26/08/2020, 5:17 pm - Rupali Jain: She is a nice teacher.
26/08/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 98337 47258: Yaa
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 98337 47258: Umm, not really
She won't have a civil discussion
Her physical lecs seemed horrible
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 98337 47258: Her most of the lecs just used to be mass bunks
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 98337 47258: She just used to read out
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - Rupali Jain: Really? I have had a LOT of discussions with her.
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - Samay Raina: True
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - Rupali Jain: No. Are you sure this is the same teacher?
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 98337 47258: Ya
Had a much different experience here
26/08/2020, 5:19 pm - +91 98337 47258: Maybe lockdown changed her üòÇ
26/08/2020, 5:20 pm - +91 98337 47258: Even Manisha ma'am, used to be a little scared of her but during lockdowns and throughout the assignments, she seemed one of the sweetest teachers

What sort of knowledge would this person have?
27/08/2020, 6:21 pm - Rupali Jain: I cannot say without knowing what program he ran.
27/08/2020, 6:22 pm - Rupali Jain: But a VERY big red flag for almost anything related to computers is when the same input gives you different outputs.
27/08/2020, 6:23 pm - Rupali Jain: So if running the same program twice with the same input gives different answers then something has gone horribly wrong.
27/08/2020, 6:28 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): The entire reason chaos theory came into being is that a computer gave out different outputs. Read a little about it. It's a different case but an interesting read
27/08/2020, 6:36 pm - Janvi Rathod: Got it
